Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Forget it.
That's a shame.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
No...
No
I hope so.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
What?
But you hate Joey
As in...
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Why?
How many people go here?
Who is she?
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Sure
We're not.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
He always look so
Does it matter?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
I know a lot more than that
Seven-thirty?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
You don't care if I die
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Were you in jail?
Then why'd you ask?
Do what?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Why not?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Oh huh
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Right.
Just for now.
That ' s what I thought
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
The Judgment is ours!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Thank God...
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
This time with me!
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
Chief knows.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
What are you saying?
New worlds create new people.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
He must be replaced.
I'm coming with you.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
What are you asking me?
Daphne, I...
Go on.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
I let her take a shower.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
A timer.
Describe him.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Is that all there is?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Hey.  I'm a professional.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Alright?
Stop it.
You're ruthless.
I love you.
I am butcher.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Where's Czech girl?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Sit down!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
A job?
You've got a call.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I want to hear everything he said.
No way!  He's mine!
How did you start the fire this time?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Don't blow your nose!
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Your doctor?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It's possible.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
How?
No.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Fortunately, they did.
What do you mean?
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
That's true.
I understand.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Luther's on the move...
Yeah, I read the report...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Hiya, kid.
How do you know?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
What do you want?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Five bills.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
You noticed...
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Of course.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
What is?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
I don't have time... I need to know.
Like shit.
So, just how big was this fare?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
You little sleaze bag!
You have nine points left on your license..
Got it...
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
And the third one?
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Which one?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
...Like love...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Because...
Been here long?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Got it.
I'm not accusing you...
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
A fellow investor.
We can do that.
Look, I don't know what this...
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Why don't they come to me?
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
How'd you find me here?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
What the fuck do you want from me?
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
That's right.
Never mind how I found you.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
You'll get it when we get there.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How much?
Child pornography.
Snuff films.
Where are your parents?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
He succeeded.
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
How are you?  Having any luck?
No.
I didn't mean to...
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
Her belongings?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
No, you may not.
I don't want to.
Kristen...
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Kristen's story really got to her.
Extra money, huh?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
What?
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
How did you know that?
She doesn't want me around
I know.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
No shit.
Faint.
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
Somewhere down there?
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Right, Skipper.
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Right at our one-eyed friend!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Wonderful!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Minus three.
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Hmm.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Saw him do it?
You know.
Break stuff?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Oh.
You're a policeman.
I want to go home.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Don't go playing policeman.
I'm not saying that.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
For a while.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Wade.
You're not using it today?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Hold on!
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Nothing.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Crawl!
Wade?
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Who?
Twombley.
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Then who shot him?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Don't you even want to ask?
Alice...
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Your father never means to be so...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
I prefered the terrorists.
Nine.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
We're not going to make it.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Copy, Air Force One.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Yes
How can you? I mean they're people.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Twenty minutes?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Flying the plane.
Where's my family?
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Commissioner.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Let me by, Elaine.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Ted!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted, please be careful.
Not now, Elaine.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Now!
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I think so.
Simon, what are you saying?!
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
You have great tits.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Scraps.
Sure.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Then Elaine was right.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Huh?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
You don't have squat.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
And still it fits?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
You are married?
I appreciate your honesty, George.
In the other man's rectum.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Nothing.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
We can't let him get away.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
What's that?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Don't tell me what to think.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
Well, thanks, I --
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Proceed inside.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Fuckin' A!
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
On my way.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Seal the door.
They're dead.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
What do you mean?
No.
In a harem.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Don't bother!
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Where?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm-tee.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
No!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
No one.
He's terribly busy, sir.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
I hope so. I need it immediately.
Majesty.
Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Why not?
Oh?
Of course not.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Ah-ha.
Yes, indeed.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Ah, love again.
Well. There it is.
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
Yes.
It's a secret.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
I don't know. He has pains.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
I liked the horse.
What is this?
Why not?
Well, we can.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Of course not.
Really? Why?
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
What work?
I'm too young to be so sick.
Consigned to flames of woe.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Do you have it?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Exactly.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
I poisoned his life.
Yes?
About the ballet.
Ah.
Who is she?
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
I beg your pardon?
Yes?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
I know.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
There is only one bed.
Of course.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Oh, come on, tell us.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Two weeks?
Lunatic?
So they said.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
You're not having a good time are you?
Right.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Okay.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Right.
Do you think it's a dog?
Not far enough. Come on.
Thanks a lot.
David!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
What?!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Oh.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Where's Matt?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
We can take blood from anything —  If it's comin' to us.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
What is?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
Oh, yeah?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Hello, darling.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Happy now?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Helen.
You haven't got a uniform?
Yes, sir.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Yes.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Yes.
Oh, Charlie again.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Yes.
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Never a good thing.
How?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
... Will Perry ...
The Army can hang him.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
He's planning a job.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
I could use the walk.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
It was exciting.
Yeah.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
What are you saying?
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Get buckets!
Ho-yah!
Shit.
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Hell of a war.
You can shut up now.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Don't care.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
Yeah Jimmy?
Mmmm.
You're sick of my company?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Sparkling rocks?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Yes ma'am.
Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I just though you were awful cute.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I can't believe this.
Can't you tell me anything?
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I can't.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Maybe.
You just haven't been looking.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Alright.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Evelyn?
We should do it.
It's not.
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
How did you guess?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It looks so soft.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Leaving what?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Oh really? That's great.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Why?
Just...say...no!
No. Flattering, but no.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Yale thing?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Eerie. Really eerie.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Yes, it is.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
We're not gonna let it.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Teddy was killed last night.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Oh, right. Hold on.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He wasn't acting?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
I do!
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
You're making me young again.
The wrong place?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
What?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Let's get him in here.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
No. Please.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
You mean -- break in?
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Please don't go.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Yes.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Thank you.
Yes?
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Excuse me?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Good on ya, man.
I'm sorry?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Do you want to talk to him?
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
Go! Just go!
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
I'll hurry back.
I'll secure the perimeter.
Lay it on me.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Sure.
Where did you learn to shoot?
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Well, it's kind of weird.
Scott.
No need. I'll call again.
... head ...
Love...
... death ...
We have met ...
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
I'm already married ...
1922. Why the kippers?
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
As per mother's instructions.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
I meant me.
I wasn't about to.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Any ideas?
That's what we were working on.
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
As far as you trust me.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
You'll find out.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Where are you going?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
What kept you?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
You're saying I have no choice.
I see.
... and now?
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Global warming?
How did you guess?
Insane ... ?
I think so, thank you so much ...
Stay by the window. By the window.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Yes I did.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
But a fabulous cook.
I think your dinner's burning.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
It looks awful.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Good...
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
You're on.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Ilene, we don't really know that.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Your whores never showed up.
Screw you!
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Rick!
Mrs.?
This isn't right.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Yeah...
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Thanks for the insight.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
You're selling dad's boat?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I know.
How do you know?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Shut up!
When I was twenty.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Homey.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Yes.
What?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Fire.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Nice boat.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
I'll be there.
Here we go...
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Investigator...
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
I forgive you.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
This psycho can.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
That 50 G could help you --
You've really got a problem.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Yeah, him.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Meaning?
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
That can be done.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Yep, you guessed it.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Calm down, please.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
Your father is proud of you.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
What point is that?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
And that's how you got me in the first place.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
I'll be right over.
I just turned twenty.
Finland.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
You slept too near where you got in?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Just a little something' somethin'.
You don't read, do you?
Maybe you need to start.
We can look out for ourselves.
And?
Where are you bound for?
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Your cousins go out with him.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Old fool!
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
Then you must get it.
May I be quite frank with you?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Shut up.  West's dead.
You did Basic here?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Tell me about them.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Sir, yes, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Why?
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Then who did?
Mr. Hardy?
My heart weeps.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Where are they!
Well, he's a good soldier.
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Nevertheless --
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
The Senator...
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
You're crazy --
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Is Dunbar cute?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
They got their stories straight.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Good idea.
So did I.
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Bullshit --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
Why?
No one's ever left.
I don't expect to.
Then do it.
Let's see it.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
What were you dreaming about?
That's terrible.
And I like you.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Okay.
What did he say?
You're right.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Probably tonight.
But it's romantic.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
That's okay?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Name it.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Right.
What?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Right.
Oh nothing.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
What? What does he want?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Sorry?
They go.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
What?
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
I said I don't have any.
Oh Jesus.
I don't hate you.
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Thank Christ for that.
I don't have nothing.
No.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Except for Small Eyes.
No. I think I better just go.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
How do you want to pay?
I need to uh...
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
I need ya help again.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
I do. God's truth. I do.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
I got others.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Don't need none.
How you let men treat ya like they do?
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
Uh-uh.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Sure.
Anything.
You can handle it.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
I know that.
Shit. Who hasn't?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
Ain't gonna be moved?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Ask the chef.
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
Yes'sir.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Yeah?
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Let go...
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
No.
Hey, when in Rome --
Let's grab some food.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
You all right?  You okay?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Where would you look for the mafia?
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
You can trust me.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
I want to go talk to him.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
How many men?
There was a change in plans.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He's got a reason.
Time, I've got plenty of.
What?
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
You trust me?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Why?
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
But not to last.
Also extraordinary things.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Nexus - 6.
Like what?
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
Industrial refuse.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Yeah.
Go.
You start.
I know all that.
And what in your estimation works?
Sorry.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Do you recognize any of them?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
I bet I would.
Of course not.
I'd kill it.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Oh.
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Hmmm?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
But then how can you...
Yes.
Go ahead.
How do you know I'm not?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
They left.
What about friends?
Thanks.
Is that why you're still here?
Really?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
How do you do?
Well, that depends...
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Eve? I'm leaving.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
You're lost?
Get away from me!!
And that's it?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Oh, I could die...
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Two weeks.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Yes.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Um-hum.
Wow.
Uh...yeah.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
No way.
Did you?
Eve, I'm sorry.
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
My mother's like that.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I promise.
Gerade aus dann links!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
No, son. A pitcher.
No. Sit down.
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
You're sure?
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
True.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Yeah...Seems to.
Of what?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Well, we're here to help!
I just hope this is still good up there.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Well, where are you --
Yeah.
You bet, hon!
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
To you maybe.
How could you?! This is just like home!
What?
Right here!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Just open the door.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
That's what I'm sensing.
What do you think, Adam?
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Or have perfect table manners.
Coward!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Give it back to him.
To get some frozen poultry.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Stop!
Um...uh...
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
Why do you do it?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Never before this.
No.
I'll go then.
Do you know?
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Sure I do.
What do you want?
Frank would open you.
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Dorothy. No!
I did. Are you?
It's okay. It's okay.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Hello, daddy.
My bourbon.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Okay Frank.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Good, let's drink up.
What?
Do you want the car?
No. No thank you.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Hey Jeff.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Alright.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Are you sure?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Dorothy Vallens?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Got it.
What?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
We... met them last night.
Our mother can see through bags.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Fuck!
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
He got beat up by a girl.
Italian.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
It is your corrupt we claim.
Rule of thumb?
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Uh... two shooters!
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
You killed my... my...
It was... It was...
Really want to know?
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
No way they could have seen it?
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
No. You sure you're okay?
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
I guess not.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
You know them personally?
Yes.
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
God have mercy on my soul.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Dignan, it's --
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
How was I ridiculing you?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
That's not bad.
You think we're going to be chased?
Where's the other stocker?
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Well, then cut it in half.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Bob?
This morning.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
I know.
Get out of the way.
It's going back down.
Yeah.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Death.
No. Bob did.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
No, I don't mind.
Sixty days?
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Is that Buckethead?
That's your friend Anthony?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Bob! Get back in position!
You're the faggot.
My brother.
I told you he's crazy.
Let's just go.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
What is it?
What's his name?
Anthony. Bad news.
Bullshit.
Now!
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Well, I think --
Is that your chiquita?
Sure.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Anything else?
One last push. One.
Bourne comes here? Why?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
No good options left?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
It was staged?
Lots of people...
No. There's nothing new.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
I worry when you get like this.
I should be better by now.
The Telegraph office.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Switch! You drive!
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
Last week? When?
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
So when was I here?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What? The tapes?
Amnesia?
If you say so.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
That's just a dream, William!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I will not.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Humbly, M'lord.
Let her speak.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
You scare me.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
What?
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
How soon?...
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Something must've happened! What set him off?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I've stopped a hundred times.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
What do you mean?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Because you're... different.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Stop! Take me back!
And...?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Hey, I got no choice.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What's wrong with you?!
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
No.
And you want to know --
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
A champagne cocktail, please.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
That's all right.
I'd better be going.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Suppose we do.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
I will.
Here's looking at you, kid.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Yes.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
But what about us?
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
How do you do?
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Right.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Yes, I get the point.
You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
-- Thank you.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Victor Laszlo.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
His escape.
This is the end of the chase.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Is everything ready?
Serves me right for not being musical.
Put that gun down.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
You think of everything, don't you?
Will I see you tonight?
I'm a drunkard.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Put it down!
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't want them here overnight.
You ever going to bed?
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Yeah, boss?
Yes, boss.
Worse than Warsaw.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Take it, damn it.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
They're on autopilot.
No.
Okay.  Sure.
Oh?  You've tried?
Had a package to deliver.
I had it on the island with me.
So do I.
For when I travel?
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Is that Jango?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Yeah.
Don't you even think about it.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
But I might not have.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
We're on.
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
To Wilson.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
They just want you to hire some new help.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Oh...
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
What do you want me to *do*?
"...did." Well, okay.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I know what you've been doing.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
What's a nanny do?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
What about the trees?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
You still doin' it too fast!
Is it true?
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
It looks like scurvy.
Obviously.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
Nobody's named this one yet.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
I'm happy I amuse you.
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Not yet. What do you know about it?
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Tough day?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Everything looks in order.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Guess so.
So we go to the bar.
We're going to give him the money back?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
You can't cheat an honest man.
I can't do that.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Great. Thank you.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
I don't trust anyone.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
My place.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
We're getting a little old for running.
You sure?
Where the hell is she?
What was it?
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
High five.
No. Thanks.
Goodnight.
I got scared.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
I despise the job.
Not like Matt, you mean.
A couple I know are getting married.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Habib?
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
You mean I won't resist them.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I. sold the car.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I don't know.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
Why not?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
No. Answer it!
It will.
You were talking in your sleep.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
In the casino.
That's fine.
You choose.
Then you're not a pro.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
It won't.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
I can't do it, Jani.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Who...
You did?
I might.
Thanks.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Good call. Help yourself.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
No.
I make it six.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
What for?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
All right, then...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
-- open quantum latches --
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Thanks.
Hello, bomb.
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Veil nebula.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
What happened, Doolittle?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
How come I never hearda you before?
None of your business.
Could you give us a moment.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I ain't mad at you...
When?
First time I ever heard that.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Too early to tell.
You got a lotta nerve.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
The other one like you...
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
I'm sorry.
You believe that?
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
Any idea when she'll be back?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
I think you should go now.
I understand.
You did.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
I just don't go in with any expectations.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
A long time.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
What if he's on the level?
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Does this person have a name?
A toy?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
I-I c-can't...
Thanks.
Right, slow...
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
Weird...
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Tickets?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
The easy way.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
NOW!
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Hello summer detention.
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Not until like... eighth grade.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Why do they call you Frank?
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Sure.
I'm going home.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Why? Is this about the book?
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
Grandma Death.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Follow him where?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I think about girls a lot.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
What about your family, Donnie?
Four times... so far.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
But you were punished.
Regret.
That I did it again.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Who is he going to kill?
Where is he, Donald?
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Why would I tell Mom?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
You can suck a fuck.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Kitty...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Raspberry.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
Thank God for bunge cords.
Really?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
You could be quiet.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
All right, then.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Yeah.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
And wear a crown and everything.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
Is that all?
But you're my father -
What's the matter with you?
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
Half watch dog?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
No, but I shot some ducks.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Now -- er --
Oh, would you...?
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Do you?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
What is it?
He fell.  He falls.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Right... Right.
Yes sir.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Well, yes.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
What a mess.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Of course! You want out?
Won't be a moment.
Oh, yes.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yyess.
My name is...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
You did this for me?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
There IS no one.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
WELCOME?
Yes.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
Goodbye, Aud...
Do you believe I love you?
It was my master Keitel's idea.
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
A lot of people like our singing.
REALLY?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
What's it all about?
So? What'd you do to her?
ROW!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
You'll be sucked down too!
What is it?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
DEATH!
I have to go...
What d'you expect me to do?
Please.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Same thing, isn't it?
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
I'm drowning! Help!
I must only let the red rage...
Easy, Dad!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Neither am I.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
In the world.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
It's okay.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Um --
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
Frost?
I'm fine.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh?
Naomi, I guess.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
I did it. I guess that means something.
Okay.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I'm Joel.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Female.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
I love you.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I guess so.
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
I'm sorry.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
We'll speak soon.
I don't know. He's not on the map.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
How do you mean?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Maybe after the holidays then.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
I know who you are.
Clockworks?
The Clock People?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Well.... er...
Whooee!
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
Can you shut it down?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
Oh God...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Justin.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
That's what we're here to find out.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
If it worked.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
Better if I just show you.
What is that?
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Understood.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Get out of there now!
What about the life readings you picked up?
Who?
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I don't care.
We're losing atmosphere...
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
1000 meters...
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
It's easy for you to be patient.
I'm worried about you.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
This makes five.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Got it, teach.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Girl...?!
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Which was?
We need to get past them.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Skeptical...?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
On the ledge?
This is how I dress all the time.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Hey-yo.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Okay, Dennis.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Hello.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
You should work for yourself.
Okay. See ya.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Sensitive -- what is that?
I've been swimming, Merv.
So what did you do?
It was nice.
No.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
What?
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
What do you want?
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
Yes.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Oh... yes.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
I'll get you the notes.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Two Cokes.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Holy shit!
Killed?
Crying? Why was she crying?
Naw! Not a major.
This is my granddaughter...
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
It's gone too far.
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Who the hell would you call?
Upstairs.
What's it for?
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Shit!
Get in line!
No. You?
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
You weren't helpin'.
Your brother, huh?
We lived near power lines.
But --
What?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
F-f-fuck you.
What the hell's going on here!?
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
That's fine.
Go!!!
We all have to be strong, right?
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I think --
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
I just hit it like you said.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
I'd like nothing better.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Who is she?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Who?
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Sort of.
Claire?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
No.
Were you a drug addict?
He's a socialist, then?
And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Are you really serious? About acting?
No, I don't hate it.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
How'd I look?
What?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
What?
What?
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Yeah.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
What's left of my blood.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
What's that?
To quarter-horses.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
And no people.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
I live here.
You think I got it?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Not long.
Sure.
Mama...?
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
You're kidding.
What?
You drove him to his torment.
Why?
You speak.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Materials. Nothing more.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
I give you my soul...
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Now husband and wife.
Open this door for no-one!
Quite a few.
It's a letter to my father.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Is that your diagnosis?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I owe you that. Done.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Are you a physician?
Ah. An explorer.
I heard.
You know of it?
My name is Frankenstein...
I will protect you.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
Okay.
I don't love Neddy.
Okay, Fireman.
Those things can be nasty.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Yes, she is.
Yes, they do.
Yes.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
I don't have the slightest idea.
Why not, against your religion?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
That happens, you'll get it back.
What do you think Mom would say?
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
No!
You asked me if I would --
You damn well better. Go.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Daddy's dead.
Not many.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
What do you mean?
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Who's...  Lieuten --
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Standing right here in my office.
I'm fine, sir.
Entering my scan now...
Smoke her.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I'm sure it is.
No, ma'am.
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Chances of recovery?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
What?
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
At first.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
Just askin'
I don't know...
Mighta been civilian.
Smoke it!
"Dad."
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
The first female President?
Great. See ya then.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Nearly four years...
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
The JFK? In the rain!?
You must have quite some harem.
It's good to see you, Nick.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Who is he?
What do I get?
That is our job.
Follow me.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Thanks.
It's the French Secret Service.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Sure.
Where are you?
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Where's my bed?
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
Must be some sort of mining facility.
I heard something. A squeal.
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
Yes but, we were wondering-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay...  Okay, now what.
What?  Up?
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
Your last name.
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Let me think. I need time to think.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
It helps.
What the hell are you talking about?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Former Commander?
How about the pig-lizard?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Get oacK on their tail.
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Yes, I believe so.
But it's more than just that, am I right?
You invented this, this...
General Lee is detained captain...
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
I... they look both the same.
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Martha!  For God's sake!
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
That's a lie!
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
George, I'm sorry.
Africa, of course.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
I think I will disappoint you.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
They can use their imaginations.
Voltaire, of course...
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
What about him?
No. What's this?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
Tell you what...
What?
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What three hundred grand?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
That's correct. Look at me.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You're an investor, is that it?
You have a card in here?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Something shouldn't be there.
Leo spanked a waitress?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
Once.
So what's the problem?
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Personally?
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It's all mine.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
Rough day on the set?
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
Don't go out of your way.
There a part in it for you?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Don't say a fuckin' word.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Harry -–
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
What money?
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
A passenger liner. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
With that coxswain dickhead.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Yeah.
Right. Wednesday.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
But how long?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Murphy.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
What the fuck -- ?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
No. I'll try again later.
Victims of what?
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
I think I see it pretty well.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Guess.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
No, really I --
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
I didn't check my messages...
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Oh my God, that's HIM!
I guess.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Why?
You loser.
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
Good.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Why?
Gross.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
She says she wants to MMPH!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Totally! Look!
Come on, it's too late now...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Where did you get that?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Like what?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
So should I come over?
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
It's kind of falling apart.
Tell me what?
Get a job!
Yes.
Did you bring that tape?
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
Jesus!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
YAAA!
...I better not...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
No, of course not.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
Yeah, well... me neither...
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Maybe she's with Josh?
I don't know.
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What are you talking about?
Do you have a check for me?
As are they all.
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Yes he is.
Well, I need to speak to him.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
I assure you we came close many times-
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Does he speak English?
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Possibly.
What did I do?
Have you ever failed?
Only in life... 
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
I won't.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
Okay, let's take a look.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Does she know anything about babies?
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
Okay.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
I await the word of Vigo.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Good idea.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
I am Zuul.
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks.  What's in there?
What?
Well, let's check it out.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Why do you want to see it?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Wow!
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Who?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
What is that... wailing?
I want that bastard dead!
Not yet, dear brother...
Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I don't know...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
As soon as I can.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
Well, they die for it!
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Chain him.
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
That's one way to look at it.
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
What?
All right.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
That woman. The older woman.
Ah. Where?
Oh.
Yes.
I don't understand --
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
My belt.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I have to go back now.
I'll think about it.
Carl who?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Hello -- who is this?
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Not exactly.
One of those outside agitators.
Well here's the purse.
Will you bring it in to me?
It's in the main ballroom.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Sir?
Let's go.
No.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
So?
Sit down.
All right. Now finish your drink.
No.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Why is it?
What?
Oh my God.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Waiter!
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Well -- goodbye then --
The number.
What?
A hanger.
What?
Are you kidding?
INADEQUATE!
Oh my God.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
What novel did you read.
How many times a year.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Well I can't.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What was your major?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Why not?
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Yes.
I see.
Are you?
Did I say that?
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Do exactly what I say.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Sir?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Not if you don't want to.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
What about it?
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Quite a while.
I will.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
I don't believe it.
Well?
The pearls are in her room.
No --
With the pearls --
I'll pay you back.
Really?
Sorry.
Money.
Why do you hide in my room?
Certainly.
Go away. Who are you --?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
And what do you do -- now?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I'll not denounce you.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Ready, Baron.
I've no luck.
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
Yes -- but the audience.
I must have made a mistake.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.
Oh -- but -- I --
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Yes -- that --
Oh -- you would!
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Oh yes, of course.
You pay me.
Moreover...
What brown hands you have.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Oh, yes.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
All right.
Mop rags --!
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Next week.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
There was -- there was.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Have I kept you waiting?
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Pretty as a picture.
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
And if you do it wrong?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Henry, no!
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Lead on.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Only one tooth?
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
No. And you have to be.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
That's right.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
You, too, Roy.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
NO!
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
Look at me.
No, baby. Come to Mama.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I'll sign that affidavit.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
What happened to Cole?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Open it and find out.
I went out to Delmar.
She didn't see you, in other words.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
What?
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
My god...
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Forget it.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Just get on the bus.
That would work.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
Doesn't make it bad advice.
Are you going to leave, too?
Thanks!
Where's Shane?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Like what?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Promise?
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
It's not working!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
We'll see.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
So long, Colonel.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Is Penelope in?
Pass the fucking catsup.
What went wrong?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Sir?
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
I'll see.
Everybody says he was so brave.
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Damn.
Make it fast.
Heaven.
Sir?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I'm engaged.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Do say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
It couldn't!
Such as?...
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
Unless she has nerve.
He cried.
Just one favor.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Out!
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
None.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You have chills?
I was going to ask.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
The new hero is you.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
How horrible.
I dunno.
What will you do, Colonel?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
What's this?
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
I don't get it.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He isn't?
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Doing what?
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
You figure!
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Marry me instead.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
Tonight's the night.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The what?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
We've got to rescue him.
He's not your son.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Yes, we do.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
Yeah.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
No, I don't.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Yeah.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
What's that shade of blue called?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Yeah.
Do you know where she would be?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
No.
Of Joanne's?
What rate?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
What the crap?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
What makes you so sure?
What happened?
But then you'll forget about me.
And better?
No.
There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
Who made it?
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Just leave me alone.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
What you got in mind?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Take it or leave it.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
Com'on, tell me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Thanks.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Eh, no.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
Do you sing and dance?
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
Sort of.
My door is always open.
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
But we can't just dig it up!
Is he all right?
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Well, I really don't smoke.
What was that?
I like you, Maude.
It's so blue.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Maude.
Oh, Harold. 
Farewell?
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
"And this too shall pass away."
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To a girl. Here.
At a funeral.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
Yes. It does.
And a lot of time.
Yes.
What kind of stuff?
You think so, sir?
Yes.
How about to slit his throat?
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Frank.
I know.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Oh, right --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
I think that is its hand.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Who wards off demons.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
No. Don't --
Myers?
Could've fooled me. Go away.
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Well good n-
Alone?
You're going alone?
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
I like that...
...Polo.
Doesn't sounds like him.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Strong.
What about you?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Where's my father?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Her mother's dead.
Who are you?
Many times.
I don't remember.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
Bastard.
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
What do you want me to do.
Good.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
And the blood let you out?
Hi. I got soaked.
I was here this afternoon.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
So damn stupid.
Larry....
Please. I can't bear it...
We don't need a bed, do we?
Yeah, why don't I?
Am I?
What's wrong?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Steve?
Maybe you should give it some time.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
What?
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
No you don't.
So lie down.
Just upstairs.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
We walk.
We're not all frigid.
Oh no.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
What happened to you?
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
Oh, so what's the point then?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Yes way.  It's really...
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
We're getting that anyway.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Do not get ahead of yourself.
I have a television.
You can be and are wrong.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Your desert island top-five.
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Yeah.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Huh?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
-- FUCK OFF!
Do it.  Do it.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Yeah.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Well stay for tonight, then.
Hi.
My house?
And do you like it that way?
Just the obvious stuff.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
What do you want to do?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Okay.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
I'm alright.
No use.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I don't know.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
You haven't even seen it!
Yeah.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Basil the II.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
That bothers you?
No.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You're a fool.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
Follow me.
I'd like you to try.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Not the same.
Damn you.
What is it you want?
Yes.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
Stop!
Your name is Conor?
Please go to no trouble.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
You're a long way from Inverness.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
You feel you know me.
I don't understand.
Not even a single lifetime.
No!
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
I have no future husband.
Who?
No doubt.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Your father must be smart.
I don't know.
You're wrong.
I want you to come to me.
Yes.
Did you know the victim?
No.
It doesn't.
American.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
Bon jour!
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
But --
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Hello, Bruce...
Then who are you?
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
That's the kind of stuff they want!
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Listen, Walter --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
You said it.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
All right, Walter.
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
I'm finished.
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
You been in a fight?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
What is it? Here!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Thanks.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Me, too.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Now what do you say?
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Mother!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
I won't, Earl. 
Sure I do, Earl.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Shut up, you!
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
A very fine-looking women.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
We want to see you.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Apparently so.
Sod.
Pauline.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
I don't know?
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
And absent bridegrooms!
They'd gone.
Where to?
Just ignore her, Mac.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
How are we going to cope?
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
Look after yourself, Grace.
How long?
I know you mean well.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
What about R.J.?
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Yeah, I'll do something.
Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I don't drive cross country.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Hell yeah.
I'll help ya.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Fine! I'll go straight!
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Tickets for what?
Oh, yeah.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
When?
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
She looks like she stinks.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Keys.
Yes, sir.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Oh, right.
I was just kidding.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
Huh?
What!
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Who's your Daddy!
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Dr. Satan?
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
We found one.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
That is the wrong fork, young man.
And?
French?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
You are sweet.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
That's not how he tells it.
Okay.
I want to be the way I was before.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Oh, Rosie.
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
You've got to respect that.
Paper or cloth?
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
I'm sorry about my parents.
Why certainly!
Terrific. Can't wait!
Yes, darling.
That's very funny.
I don't know. Something.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
What?
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
It would just be helpful to know.
No.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Have you?
Really?
Lila...
Ugnh.
Tomorrow, the acid test.
No.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
Pittsburgh?
Comin' in or goin' out?
No, I'm fine.
Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
Thank you.
Deal the cards.
Do you really think you can beat him?
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
What did he say?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
You think I can lose?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Now, when did you adopt me?
You know everybody, don't you?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Come on, let's go...
Where?
I don't know.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Aaaahhhh!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Who's he?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Get with what?
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Gimme ten bucks.
Ten dollars.
You're a pretty good player.
Yes.
Eight o'clock.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
Give me a drag.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Thanks.
I've got something in my bag.
Give it back to me.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Well, he owns things.
For how long?
Come here. Come on, now.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Just for luck.
I'm a little tired.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Game's over, Eddie.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
Yes.
I only protect myself -- !
Have you always had it?
Humans.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
I guess you could say that.
That's the Air Force Base.
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
Okay.
Was there anything over the hill?
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
Yes -- but ...
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Why?
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
What's his family background?
You have to leave the White House.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Did it work?
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Haven't you been watching?
You still got the Olds?
That's okay. You're driving.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Dad...
Moishe, please, don't talk.
But what, General?
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
No Sir. Definitely not.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
He's doing a good job.
Dick-weed!
I should have done this a long long time ago.
I'm a dancer.
How to kiss ass.
So push it!
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What do you want us to do?
You are on your own?
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
What is it?
It looks like a converted church.
Where did this come from?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
But what are you doing here?
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Good point.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Well, uh...
How did you she was a Nazi?
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
Dad!
I know, Dad!
You call this archaeology?
Penitent. Penitent...
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
That was seven hundred years ago.
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
Come on -- come on!
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
No.
Then we'll die.
My name is Kazim.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
There are no stories anymore.
Yes, I understand.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
No.
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Two are still missing.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
It's pulling me deeper!
Just one arm!
PET IT??!!
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
What -- the bug?
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
I'm going down.
So now they believe me.
You got it!
I know you did!
Al ???!!!
What street?
Yeah?
No.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
That a new Datsun?
Me? What'd I do?
Then how'd I get here?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Then what are you stopping for?
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
Go out, take your first left.
Where are we going?
It's illegal.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
...Just beautiful.
.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Are you serious?
She's the toughest to read.
Not her. You!
It's not your time. I get time off.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
A hard left. A hard left.
Neither can they.

No. You can't trust her.
I don't trust her.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
About what?
It's all we've got.
The best part. She'll love it.
It's a long story.
Who's our little man?
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Join us.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
I think I've heard of you.
Oh.
Do what?
We're here.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
I didn't say anything.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
...I...don't know.
Disinterest?
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
Who do you work for?
There's not much to tell.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
This business is over.
What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
What?
You coming along?
This going to work?
What'd...you forget?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Now what?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Nothing we can do.
It was my choice.
I've never met anyone like you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
If he was able, what would he say.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
I don't know.
A drink...
It is?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Monday.
Push it.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
You're exaggerating!
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Catch ya' later.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Okay.  Lowell?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Is there any more rice...?
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Yeah.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
All right. See you...
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
What do you mean?
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
Lowell.
I disappeared on you?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Give me a break!
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
Everything interests me.
Like what? Your sign?
If you want to do it.
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
It's okay.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
I don't think you really understand --
I heard.
What?!
What?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
I told the truth... I told the truth.
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Triple!
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
I should be in therapy.
Got any symptoms?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Isn't everything?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Why would you be here?
No. I haven't. Have you?
Gotcha.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
What is it Miles?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
I thought so.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Sometimes I forget.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Right.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
My client has ruled that out.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Video.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Is she going through with it?
Miles -- why so angry?
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Who's "Patty."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Yes, sir?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
We'll go into that some other time.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Do you love her?
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
I knocked several times.
Oh, yes. I heard.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Fine man to fall in love with.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, please, Dad—
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
If you really mean it, I will.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
We've done that already.
What do they say?
Amateurs!
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
But the lady says—
No.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Driver!
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
You have your nerve!  Here, boy—!
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Like this. I have no robe.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I don't trust that chatterbox.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Aren't you afraid of me?
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
You're prejudiced.
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Hay—in my teeth.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Oh, no!
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Come on! come on! 
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Sorry, Miss.
What's that?
I said, the old man's screwy!
The dame's too smart for him.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
What!
Okay, pete. 
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah?
Collect.
Mebbe.
Hey, you!
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Yeah—wouldn't it?
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Did he pay?
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
You're not digging.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
What do you mean?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
Please answer the question.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Huh?
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
No.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
More than ten years.
And Oswald?
The assassination, Jack?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
That's it.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Virginia.
What are they?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
Uh-huh.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
Okay.
Who do you think I am?
In cash.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
'74, I think.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
It's different with men.
I'm old enough to be her father.
I go back to work tomorrow.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
When did you decide?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Where's the rest of it?
In a dress.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
Why?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I didn't say you did.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
She told you that?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Uh-huh.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
Buy ya a beer?
Great...  ...Wanda!
Uh-uh.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
All your money's in Mexico.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Who?
But you don't?
Uh-huh.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Fourteen.
Where were you?
About five years ago.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
What do I do?
The moon -- I dunno
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Yep.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
You couldn't just hit her?
Pretty sure.
We went to the parking lot.
You gonna tell me who it was?
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
You think you could do that?
Livingston, huh?
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
Uh-huh.
And you did that to protect my interest?
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
It's fun.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
Oh, terrific.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
There was a bang.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
Why do you say that?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I haven't seen her in months.
Ah!
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Hell, you think I am?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Jacob Singer.
Whataya mean, no record?
It's freezing.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
She was good in bed, though.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Save me!
Don't ask.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
I don't know.
They're weird names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Gabe.
I just want to look ...
What's wrong?
Show me Della!
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Remember that.
It might be for me.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
I can waitress. I'm good.
Bullshit!
Sit down.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
I'm tired.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Then don't bug me.
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Where are they?
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Lennox Hospital.
Paul Gruneger!
A long time.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Nope.
I just need to talk.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know what to do.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Is he all right?
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Punk?
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Oh, come on!
What do you mean, not enough time?
No.
Done?
Delongpre! Out of time!
He came for me, I had to run!
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Where'd you get the gun?
What are you doing back?!!
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
We could convert fission transistors.
I am an expert!
What?
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I get it.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Shut up, Thorgan!
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Maybe she tripped.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Barbie from hell...
Good point.
I missed you too.
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
That's right, now if you could...
What have I done?! Idiots.
Here --  Take him home.
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
No!
He's taken him!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
How can you tell?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Do I set the goddam hook?
So would I. Come on in.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Yep.
Well... is everything all right?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
No way! He can't!
I don't think so.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm supposed to be running.
I'll try to drop by later.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
I totally heard you did.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
I try really hard, actually...
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
What are you talking about?
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
I rock a Harmony.
You weren't even alive!
Yeah.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Oh.
I wrote that.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
I don't know.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
I heard that was you.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Sure.
You found us in the Penny Saver?
I went to the doctor today.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
You're not listening to me.
You sound shocked or something.
Right, seriously.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
They're yellow.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Have you found a place to stay?
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
Yeah.
...That's not true.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Vernon, Florida.
What do you need a Bible for?
Now why is that?
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
A... I gotta go.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
I don't want to talk about it.
Fuck!
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Then try again, 
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
...Brian hurt his foot.
Shut your mouth.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes.
With how many people?
How?
What do you want?
It is right.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
Yep.
Darcy?
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Right.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Yeah. Do it again.
Right now?
Come on.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
No.
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Passion...
Mine?
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Do you know where he went?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah is dissdee?
Yep.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
Yeah.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
You are!  I don't like you.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Then what's he talking about?
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Run it down.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Who is this?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
The pipes.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Nice meeting you.
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
And this Jeremy--
It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
What about the way he arranged the body?
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Who says something's on my mind.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
How come you don't stay with them?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
That's a very personal question.
I don't think I could.
This isn't a game.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Of course.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Doesn't that scare you?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Nothing.
You don't understand.
Why not?
Colwyn.
That way. I can feel the cold.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
The new Queen lives.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
You will know, in good time.
Yes.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Where the spiral begins.
No! You cannot know that!
I don't think that.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
You and I will guard the fire.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
I'm all right.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
We must try to get horses.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Go. I command you.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
Sugarballs?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
No. He will master the leader.
I knew.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Where is he? My son.
No.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Huh... 500 meters?
How can you say it?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
No.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I don't know... Five minutes.
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
For a walk.  I don't know.
How serious is it?
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
That's enough.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
What?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
You can't change your mind.
Yes.
It'll make it.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
From where?
Yeah!
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Perhaps there's another route?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Tomorrow.
California.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
What Mr. Parker?
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
What?  Who are you?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
What do you think I should get?
No.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
Yes.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
What?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Can we just ignore it?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Who?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Yes.
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
Is everything okay?
About the alibi --
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
He chose them already?
What?
I don't know.
Definitely! I love him!
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
How'd it go at the trial?
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
Uh -- family.
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
You're serious?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Absolutely!
What?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
So are you!
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
No, silly. I go here.
You got into Harvard Law?
Uh -- sure.
Thank you. Having fun?
Thank you.
Really?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Do it now!
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
What do you want from me?
Oh, yes...
I don't expect you'd understand.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
And, now?
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
East of Mercia?
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
I fear she's lost.
What does she want from me?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Good plan that.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Why not mine the damned walls?
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Go on... go on...
Or perchance...
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
To fetch your napkin.
My father and the Baron.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My lady mocks me.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
You're teasing still.
Biting you?
I can't see a thing.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Is she fair, this princess?
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Oh, but I have.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
He was there and then he wasn't!
I wanna be with you today.
Oh.
I would have anyway.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Is that legal?
Nope.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
What are you doing here?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Yeah.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
Does everything have to have a point?
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
Okay.  I guess.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Will he talk to me?
It's thirty feet.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
I didn't recognize you!
I want you both to stay.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll get your bag.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
I'm not doing it!
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
Hey...hey!
You can't make me do a thing.
Try it.  It feels good.
What would you be doing now?
Why wouldn't she leave?
That's so weird...
What's wrong with your back?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Oh.  Sorry.
Because Dad left?
He doesn't answer.
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
I was parked in day parking.
I love those doors.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Well, for later then.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I'd rather you not be here.
Going on?
You bit my finger.
I need to know.
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
So could I.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
No.
Does Alyssa know?
You got any weed?
I wasn't sure.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
I'll make you something.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
Either do you.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
No, nigger.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
You still got that map?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Make 'em throw strikes.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Hey, Ray...
1932? That's like, that's like...
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
They gave me life, mama.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Satchmo.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Blacks welcome there?
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
She's so nice.
It would be so okay.
No.
Oh. Sorry.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
Put it in your mouth.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Release the evil?
Yes, Jimmy.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Definitely.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
So go get 'em, Dad!
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I know, your wickedness.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Boogerland!
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
See ya, fellas.
You keep a bat under your seat?
All right...
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Sometimes, sure.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
I think I'm floating.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Yeah. The deep South.
A black guy?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Just the face.
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
I'm in my party mood.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Well then...?
Curious.
Six. I go red next year.
Then it's still no.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I wish I knew what you think I know.
I have.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Things change!
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Hello.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
Oh, yes... I think...
Too little.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Sure, I'm okay.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Me, too.
I used to.
Pornos.
Yeah.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
You talk to him?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
What are you going to do?
Yeah?
I guess so.
Thanks, guys.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
What job?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Which would you choose?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
What?
You want some company?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
I was?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Yes!
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
In a quandary.
Huh?
Gold. You were going to—
Nothing. Why?
How do you do?
That's intelligent.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Well, it must have taken–
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
108 and still active?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
Yes, charming.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
Please let me help you.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
No porters here!!
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Yes.
Hello? Colonel?
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
That's what you said.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Shhh!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
What was that?
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Why?
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
What?  I thought you just--
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Let's check am out.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
There's a god damn good reason.
We're rising.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
For how long?
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
No.
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
I dunno. One?
Yeah, Kay?
They're not my pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Come again?
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Can you see the balloon man?
Anderton, leave.
Please --
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
I have to go back.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Because I found out about her...
About who?
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
How do I find the --
For that, we have to go for a ride.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Try again.
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Don't worry, Lamar.
What?
In the middle of the night?
And who the hell is that?
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
Uh, sir...
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
To Hineman?
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Oh... Hi, John.
Tell me how.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Tell me!
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
None of your damn business.
What?
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
No.  He can't...
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Sure.  Raincheck.
You mean after he lost your son.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
I haven't seen him in two years.
When served warm --
Thank you very much, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Manhattan.
Bullshit.
No.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
I love you. Come home.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
There's no touching.
Get your hands off of her.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah.
Excuse --
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Me? No. Not really.
This one?
Pshhh...
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Yeah.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
He'll work it off.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
No. That's cool, man.
Depends what night.
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
It's important.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Bye.
Fuck them.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
I think we might.
He implied it.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
You sure?
Great. On my fucking room.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
What are you doing?
They didn't say an address?
Nothing else.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
You fucking nuts?
You got that right.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Where?
You want us strapped, don't you?
I'm your soldier.
Did you hear what he just said?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You're out of money?
No.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Three and a half hours?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
The line's over there.
Ugh...
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
You strapped?
You really in trouble?
You want another drink?
You're from LA, right?
You'll love it.
Thanks.
You rode?
What?
What about my keys?
But, Max --
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Scotland.
Heard where?
How 'bout that?
What?
That really you, Red?
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Elijah who?
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
I can handle it.
How do you know?
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
Betty it's me. It's me.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
I told you we don't know for certain.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Sure, man.
With him?
I mean it's late, baby.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
What mission?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
And don't come back.
C'mere.
Me?
Might be all right.
Head nigger in charge?
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[I have a friend there.]
Where does he live?
Where?
[Daniel.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
I drink.
How does it affect you?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
Yeah. Two or three.
I know you're not.
Frank. Frankie.
Be a swimmer.
You're American.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Last night. Do you know something?
What was her name?
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
I'm trying, mom.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
What? Who?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
He has to go.
That's what friends do.
Yeah, sure.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I came to see you. How you feel?
You told me.
She gave me the evil eye.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
No...
Okay.
Sure, what?
Sure, great if you ain't married.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Marty...
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Hiya, Ralph...
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
On accounta...
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
He said it for us all, Walt.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
The chest-cutter.
Call Dago Red.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
When?
People will talk.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I think I heard about that.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
An eternal damnation.
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
I don't get it.
He can move in here with us.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
Ayuh.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Of course not.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
You really say the cutest things.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Glad to help.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
They can't do that to me!
I out-coached that General Hammond.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Nice.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Um-hum.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
A deal?
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
Thank you.
Did you find her?
Go out and find her!
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
What?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
. . . Tubby?
Who?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
A what?
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
Well?
Why—uh—
No, I didn't.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Oh!
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Yeah.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
Not that we know of.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Is that where you're family lives?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Earl.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Yep.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Explain how that works.
We see each other every couple of months.
Where did you hear that?
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Get good at it.
Yes.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
And doing a very good job of it.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Let me show you something, Ray.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
And it's hard to get.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
...Let me just show you.
Do it!
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
What do you want?
This is how you pick up women --
No...
Just like you always wanted.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
What about the customers with reservations?
-- Yes.
Go!
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
It's not used for anything.
Why?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Yes.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Describe program function.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Resurrection.
Speed?
Yeah, right.
... Let's take a look over there.
WHITE TIGER!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
About twenty seconds in your time.
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
BULK!!
Quack like a'duck!
Awwh, Charlie.
You scare me, Charlie.
So what happened?
Could we step outside?
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
What's that divided four ways?
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Who hired the bastard?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
For what?
Same here.
You're sure?
Have you thought about this?
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
And I got it all planned.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
I got partners.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
What?
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Sad commentary, huh?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
I need a new PR guy.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
I'd better go report this...
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
<u>What</u> union?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
I don't <u>know</u>.
Isn't that Lulu?
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
We like to think so, yeah.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You don't like where I live?
Uh-huh?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
Mother!
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
I can make my own decisions.
Mm hmm.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
And where is she?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
It was?
It couldn't be.
No!
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
No.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Why me?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
*You won't?*
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Yes. Come in.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Well--he's got nothing on me.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
A *day*!
How?
Yes, I see that.
Pardon?
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Have I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Must have been tickled pink.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
"So help me God."
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
I know that.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Yeah?  And what else?
Why don't you do it yourself?
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Jim, you don't have to--
But--if he *does*, Joe--
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
He sure is.
Any children?
You are , aren't you?
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if—
What did they say?
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Really?
You have?
Yeah, I know.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
People have been crucified before.
Huh?
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Hello.
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!  She is out the door.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Boy, was he burning.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Wants to know who the heir is.
What?
How do you do.
All right.
Are your parents living?
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
What for?
Huh?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Entertainment?
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
It takes so long to detect them—  —because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Yes, sir.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
South Dakota - but on the top.
Oh. Oh!
Yeah. What?
Every man to his taste, sir.
Oh, I do too, sir.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Really? You think so?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
What kind of doubts?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
You are so mean.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
Oh?
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
You like me. How come?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Why do you watch?
Doc.
He told you.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Don't need it.
Is she a friend of yours?
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Hmm.
We'll work it out.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Disgusting.
You like it?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
That's one way to put it.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Um-huh.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Which show was that?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
Will you be here?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
It's a big part of the show.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
Is that the question?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I can tell you anything else.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
That'd be Lily.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
No... no training.
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
You're not going to kill us?
And how does one do that?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Immune from what?
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Water turning to blood.
And what did he say?
Two hundred pounds.
Forty.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Every damn day.
I know my treasure.
Oh that's comforting.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Who was talking about what?
Something like that.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
I'm staying.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Read the inscription on the cover!
Oh.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
What --?
Fantasizing... about you.
Do I?
Do it, big boy!
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Hello?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
You're nuts.
Every night.
Yeah.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Me, too.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Yes.
And you are a fool.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
LOOK!
How could I see him if he's invisible?
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
I'll drive.
Not a chance!
Anybody got any?
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Wow.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
You did?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Ask her out.
Whatever our name is.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
It's suicide.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
And, what a delightful idea!
I think it's absolutely charming.
No, thank you.
Are you serious?
Any cannon?
There are none here.
Where are they?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
And where is the army?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Oh, shit, that's not right.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Oh, yes... of course.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Ah, that is good.
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Of course.
One had better legs.
I don't understand you.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
How do you know?
Can you give me a drink, please?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Show him in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
Send him in.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Why you say that?
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
I'm gone.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
I can't taste nothing.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Nothing.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I don't play for no team.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Excuse me?
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Sorry, my ass.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Get on!
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
You just come in on Amtrack?
It was because I had this...in my pocket
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
You...
How should I...?
Keep your voice down.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
Over and out.
No...kisses to you.
I'm just an accountant.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
What!?
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
What?
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
You're a big girl, huh?
Put her on.
No.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Dad, you're bleeding...
I will guard Pearl with my life...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
About what!
Twenty-five wives!
Come on!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Satan.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
I'll make coffee.
Is that all?
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Yonder.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
How's that?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
My flesh and blood!
Where's your Missus?
When did I ever?
Now who was this?
What?
The man! The man!
I sure as hell hope so.
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
Haven't slept, have you?
Not really.
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Well what you reading it for?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Krueger.
It wasn't that serious...
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
Warm milk. Gross.
We should get her out of here...
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
No more fights?
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Naturally, Comrade.
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
I see.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
Tell me... what else did you have?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
No, that's bad management.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Good evening, Monsieur.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Certainly.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
I'll send you a muff.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Oh no. No visa.
At what intervals does he whistle?
Thank you.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Yes, it is.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
That is correct.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Because we are an odd couple.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Probably not.
Do you like Scotch stories?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
No.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no music.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Oh, Leon!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Yes, Swana.
How do you do?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
In that case I can only say good-by.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I will do my best.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where is that?
My jewels?!
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
Yes ... I got the money.
Is it?
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
Jesus!  Through a window?
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
Silence!
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
How is this national security?
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
Jesus!
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
It's the parents' fault really.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
You should ask Bobby.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
Kissinger?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Agreed.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
Yes.
Why?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
That was a long time ago.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
... but it was all we had.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
The hell with 'em.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Fire him.
No, sir ...
Well, we could delete it.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Thank you.
There'll be time for that.
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
I am older.
In Angola. Yeah.
Yes, you've circled round.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
No ID in her room?
Uh-huh.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Nothin'?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Llewelyn Moss?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Hyah!
That's very nice.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
I wouldn't worry about it.
No. But I gave my word.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
You know what's goin' on?
I know where the money is.
I can't say.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
All right...
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
With anything?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Everything.
All right. Heads then.
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
The option.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I been immobile.
What did I say?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
I got an overcoat on.
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
Did you send anyone out there?
Bad idea...
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
That's a nice name for what you need...
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
...I... I know what you are.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
...what're you saying?
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
All the time...
You never gave us a chance...
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What's so special about it?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
That is a skill!
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Yes.
You're in serious danger!
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
I'd slap his face.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Really?
Worse.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Ahh... my wife's.
Like what?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
He told us it's in the Buick.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
I'm not telling.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
It just didn't fit her profile...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
What do you mean?
You better believe it.
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
No... before that.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Waitaminute -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Good Lord, what do we do?
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Now Penny, stop that!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Not your...
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Don't I know it.
Million point two.
Isn't it, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
He's a suitor!
I been calling for four months.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Naw. That's over with.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
What did you call me, boy?
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
You hope.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
I do.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
My kinda group!
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Why'd he do it?
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
I bet you do!
Hey, Sid, thanks.
I've seen better.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
But it can't wait.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
Yes.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
NOT THAT ONE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
Keep your voice down.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Everything okay?
No, you can't come in.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
How many more do we have after this?
What?
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
The crowd goes wild.
Fuck her too.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
Fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Uh uh.
What if I keep dropping?
I'm sorry, Mom.
What are you doing with the gun?
What's up?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Damn straight.
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Are you finished?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
You mean...
We need money first...
Wait a second there brother...
Yeah... let me think about it.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Yeah.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Like the manual says, "Information is...
Maybe...
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
You don't look alright.
No.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I said, I'm not my sister.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
Prisoner exchange.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
Not yet.  What happened?
It's already over.
It's safer if we stay together.
How old are you?
Flanking riders?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Four, five miles.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Put them away.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
To remember.
Huh?
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Well, maybe I----
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Does she love the cat?
We're still not where we're going.
What did we do, Jud?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Well...a touch of the flu...
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Leave me alone!
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
I got eggs down here!
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Did you, now?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
What?
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
It doesn't!
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
What's your plan?
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
We'll see about that.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Sorry, I didn't know.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Somewhat.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
My father.  William Turner?
I swear, you look just like him.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Jack!
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Why are there two ottomans?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Consideration?
I'm so excited, Icarus.
I like Trix!
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Is that what Argon told you?
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
So, I guess it worked.
The big house.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
No, something is really wrong... look!
I don't know.
Got it.
What happens?
No, no, I just feel wired!
What?  What's wrong?
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
The nanobot... it's not here...
Argon's private lab.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
The question is, are you?
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
I don't mind her if you don't.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I see.
O-o-oh, I get you—  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
Mother!
We were classmates.
Oh, is that so?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Yeah, little Gloria.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
My play.
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Right.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Well, at best you might deny it.
You don't.
Okay - you remember Joe—
It's all right. Bring him in.
Hello, Joe.
All right, Grandma—
I beg your pardon?
I understand, sir.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
It's haunted just the same.
Very good, sir.
Sure.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
... Sex.
Ah.
Yes.
It can't be possible.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Thanks.
Bud brought it to me.
No she's not.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
... Lover's Lane.
What are you doing?
So.
No it couldn't!
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Yes I do.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
No it isn't.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
No way.
I don't know.
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Hunh.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Yes.
How come I'm still in black and white?
What?
Oh ... Right.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Marmalade.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
My name's David.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
... Hi.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
BUD.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Yeah ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Really?
Yeah.
A miracle.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
Hello.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
You look nervous.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
I'm gonna call you back.
It's not mine.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm in my bedroom.
Sure.
No.
...yeah.....
You sound very cute, very nice.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
You're going to work now?
Yes.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
Are you telling me no?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Yeah.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Ok.
Sure.
Alright?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
What did he want?
...yeah...
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
This really looks like Hawaii here.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yeah.
I'm fine are you ok?
Ok.
So here we go.
It's a plastic, yeah.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do that.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
And your Social Security number.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Can you hang on a second?
Yes I'm fine.
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
So what should I do with the pudding?
WHICH?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
What do you have in the house?
You have another house somewhere or something?
Are you serious with this?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
I'll see you there.
I won't.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Ok.
So...did my brother call you?
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Enough to discern its tenor.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
Good day, Marquis.
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
A man after my own heart...
An innocent child is dead.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
Was it impotence?
Shut down?
You find this amusing, do you?
Of course.
No. It most certainly was not.
That's not our intent --
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
But I am history.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Yes?
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
But it's just begun --
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
I can't
So I've been told.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
It's not really--
How much?
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
I just want to understand--
The drinking.
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
What are movies about?
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Please don't say this.
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
They don't have to.
Craig is one syllable
I don't care.
I don't give a shit about-
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Well, at least she's off KANE today
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
It's too late. The movie's made
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You're lying to me.
Pardon?
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Here's your glove.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
You wasn't with her?
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Yeah, I know.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
Where you been?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
You're hurting my arm.
I went to the movies.
Yeah --
No, not that.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Are you drunk?
All right, just don't make any noise.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
But his leg!
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
I was jaywalking.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Give him evidence.
Your Lisa?
I told you that --
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Like what?
Something wrong?
Why should I?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
I was.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
And some man will lose his.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Uh-huh.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
No.
Smart girl.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Who's Thorwald?
And your stomach?
Only because it's expected of her.
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
That's good news.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
For what?
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Three.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
There's nothing to see.
What are you getting at?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
Thinking about Thorwald?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Too close.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Phone number?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Give me some dirt.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Hold it, Jim.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
I better clean this up before she sees it.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
You what?
You don't want me to go.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
Have some cigars.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Are you going down there?
Stay here.  That was my son!
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
Hi there.
He has a knife.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
It's me!
They're looking for you!--
I'm what?  What?
Why?
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
What do you think?
I need it.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
Leave me alone.
No.
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Oh.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
What's he like?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
He hates me.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
What?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Daddy--
I didn't want to stop.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
I've been doing good, though.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Yeah.
No, hey, I like your coat --
One more. Smile. One more.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick, I love you --
JESUS CHRIST!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Part of... with them?
He says he wants it now.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
Wish I had a brother like you.
I don't know.
I'm gonna need some money.
...never... tried...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
No.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
He's not Nick Mason...
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Five years. Since it opened.
My what?!
How do we do that?
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
I promise you, I didn't know!
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Ain't there yet.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Yeah.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Aw, Rudy.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
No, man! No, no, no!
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Pam Grier.
How can you tell?
Did the two of you talk?
Me and Mr. White?
The Brewers.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Why am I Mr. Pink?
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
He don't tip.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
What're you talkin' about?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
I'm okay.
Bet your sweet ass we are.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Why not?
I got the diamonds.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Not these guys.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
His letters will keep.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Hold on.
I hope so, too.
You should know. She's in your dream.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Maybe it's better that way.
Maybe they will.
How's that?
Like what?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
Can I have my gun back?
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You want to split up? --
Kind of sore.
Nobody asked you to.
I said I didn't care.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
I don't like to see you go.
And we're running out of that.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Stop it --
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
No.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Oh, sure.
Let me do that.
If you need me, I'll be --
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Do I know you?
Would you die already?!
Thanks.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
He's so brave.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Okay.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
It looks like the furnace.
Yes...
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
I know, but I've been thinking --
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
So, whatever happened to her?
That means more screen time for us.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
I don't need your help.
You could use the grade, huh?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Let me see the files.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Even in the bathroom?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
The keys. She took the keys.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Yes.
Then let us prepare.
No, I'm fine.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
What happened?
Is MOM... in there?
Jeeezzz!
I certainly did not.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
No woman would!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
I know Dottie!
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Who is this?
COCKSUCKER! 
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
There is one big problem though.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Where?
You can't tell.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
What sort of danger?
She could use a hundred dollars.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
I ought to know.
What is it?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Goodnight, Mary.
Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
They may have been friends of hers.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -— you're off to work.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
I'd forgotten.
Tell me what?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
No other reason —— no woman ——not the little Miss Gibson?
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
No, she's with her sister,
Why?
I don't believe it.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Yes?
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I should have known. She had no sincerity —- no real belief.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
How do you mean?
Agreed.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
My therapist said that --
You're in therapy?
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Videotapes.
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Then do it.
Yes.
Absolutely not.
Her name was Elizabeth.
What was the problem?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Don't you get lonely?
And you feel the same way with John?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Who'd you have lunch with?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Why?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Radon leakage?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
What are you talking about?
Well, why?
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I can't believe you did that!!
You couldn't do it, period.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
You are in serious trouble.
Did you take your clothes off?
It was busy.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I just want to know why you're here.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
And that's all?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
I would.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
No.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.
What's so stupid about it?
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Student?
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
Time to check with Flavors.
Nothing.  Just...memories!
I got it!  I got it!!!
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Who trusts experts?
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
...closed?
Now Betty, don't overreact.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
But I don't need treadment.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
Absolutely correct.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
I NEED SOME
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Surely.
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Anything I'd know?
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Now we're talking.
Now.
It's not even a mile.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
You know that chick?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm a quick learner.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
With this chick.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
What? Of course I like Christine.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Nope.
Is what the money thing?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
Put me down, Jack.
It's private.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
What's that?
The plan is... you go.
Hold on.
I feel like driving.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
Whatever. Sorry.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh yeah? How is it?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Hey.
What was the bottle that did it?
Yeah, same here.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Thanks.
Good. So did I.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
I guess.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
Only for pee or poop.
My ballet recital.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
I heard.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
I got him.
What does it matter then?
We have to go in the basement.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Oh.
They win.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Why not?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
There's nobody coming?
Sounds good.
Where were you?
They've been kind to me.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Yeah... that must have been it.
And you're not Baxter, either?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
No, Leavenworth.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
What now?
He is now.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
We'd rather stay.
It's none of your business.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
I heard that too.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
I've given that up.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I just got to town.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Good-bye, Paden.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Here he comes right now.
He left me.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I don't want you to get hurt.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
I can't wait to meet her.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
If it's on the page...
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Simone does not control my destiny.
That's true.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Not quite.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
I have to talk to her.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And what may I ask brought this on?
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
It was more in passing.
Absolutely not!
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I'm already dead.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
You know me -- married to my work.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
They are alive, Sayer.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
Er,... good.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
You're in breach.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Yes.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
The only real truth is in the work.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
Thanks.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
If it's okay with you?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
I forgot myself.
Your eyes told me.
Me too.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Oh.
Tell you my secrets.
Standing next to my window.
What?
Cole, please stop.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
Stuttering--
Chuck E. who?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Could take a little while, though.
Two.. maybe three days.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Fuck you.
Slut.
Which street corner?
...Hi.
The band.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
I didn't do anything --
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Harvest moonshining!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
"Blood?"
People say he was a murderer.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Amen.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Nothing to tell.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Mmmm -- so can I...
Wait a minute --
Don't look.
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Bill, we need to talk!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Just checking out the lights.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
That wasn't a good night, no.
We're coming your way, man!
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
It's just a work thing.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Grant, no!
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
You.
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
A what?
You just passed your nemesis.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
But I still don't think...
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Not for long, you ain't.
What does the old Timex say?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
We're gone.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Oh.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Of course. Yes.
Maybe.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
You're sure?
And that didn't seem odd to you?
And threw us into the lake.
I'm not doing cocaine.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
You're finished.
You got clicks, anything?
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
-- never in a million girl --
You love her?
That takes some of the sting out.
Security's locking down the elevators.
What else did Padiche say?
You're not Gibarian...
Why would you let her to do that?
Will she come back?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Get out --
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
Why?
You didn't look very happy.
You talk like an actor.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
It's something.
What kind of look?
You don't love me.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
If you're here.
You should have told me.
You never said you wanted one.
I can't stay here.
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Why do you say that?
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
You didn't like him?
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
I'll come with you.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
I'll miss you, Mike...
Open the door, will you?
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Let's do it.
Yeah.  It's all over.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Nothing.
My ass is falling.  It is.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Does it make you... hard?
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Yeah, I think so.
How about dinner tonight?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
I don't think she can sing, either.
No. No, that's okay.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
A spider.  Eight legs.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Thank God.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
You sure about all this?
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
See?  You big dullard.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
How much do you know about it?
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
He'll try to finish his experiment.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Phooey on that.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Get going on the trap door.
You stink, Sefton!
You make my mouth water.
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
You are talking crazy!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Isn't it?
Jawohl?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Betty Grable!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
No?
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
He's the grrrrreatest!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Bombs away!
What do they always say?
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Says me.
We did it.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
December seventh, forty-one.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
Where is he?
Full disruptors.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
What do you mean?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
I believe so.
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Commander.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
What's the "Nexus"?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
I hadn't planned on it.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
Phasing? To where?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
No, I didn't know that.
Make it so.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Aye, sir.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Nothing. As before.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
What is it?
Not from here, no.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Short range scan.
David --
Why?
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Aye, sir!
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
What? What are you saying?
Count on our help, sir.
I'll need it, Sulu.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Yours...?!
Who is this?! How dare you --
But, why?
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Understood, my lord.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They know we would die first.
Yes, my lord!
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I'm trying, David.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Do it, while we have time.
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
The word is given: warp speed.
I am understandably curious.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
I would not presume to debate you.
Yes.
It would explain a great many things --
Aye sir --
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Spock...!
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Distance from Reliant...
Visual.
Honors -- hup!
Never, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Fine. Just fine.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Then how.?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
We are launching everything we have.
The hell they did.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Iowa.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Implicitly.
Just lucky, I guess.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
... Who are you?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
So. There we are.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
I cannot tell a lie.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Mr. Sulu?
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
I am well, Admiral.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
... Are you joking?
They are my friends.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
There are days.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I believe it is safe, sir.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
If it works you mean.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Commander Riker...
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Transferring controls to manual.
Picard to Crusher...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Why was Data assigned?
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
I never kissed you with a beard before.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Yes...
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
You think they're still up there?
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
I do not know what you are referring to.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
What's still there?
As they used to say... all systems are go.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
One minute to warp threshold...
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
You don't sound French.
There's a few of us left.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Steady as she goes.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Where the hell are they going?
Commander... we have a problem.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
You may need assistance, doctor...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
No way.  You see this?
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Retire.
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
Shields up. Battle stations.
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Captain.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Krandog aranty.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Possibly.
Aye, sir.
I always wanted to try that.
Sulu!
When does this conference start?
From Enterprise?
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Spock, you want to know something?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
What?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
I think  not.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
Yes, sir.
No.
No.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
It'll serve you right.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
And this makes you "sad"?
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
An individual more like you, you mean.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Thank you.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
How could I not?
Make it so.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Theories?
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Sir?
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Sir --
It's working.
And the Romulans invade.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
You're not Reman.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I don't know.
On my way.
He's a very unusual android.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
They're holding position.
They will obey, Praetor.
I came this far alone ...
Praetor.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
It's still the full price.
No.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
When can we expect containment?
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
This is George Fox...
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Good.
That way.
Coupons.
Smile.
No gas.
This car runs on gas.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Horses.
It was yellow.
No.
Eh... yes...
No... The closest...
The driver will...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Yes?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain...
What is hell?
It's bad.
I am your friend.
Why?
Yes. Sing some more.
I will go. But not you.
You promised.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
I understand.  Thank you.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
Fly.
Sure.
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Doesn't make sense.
We're ready.
Can you see under the faceplate?
Was there visual contact?
Twenty-eight years.
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
What's all this squid shit?
Leave him alone, Tran.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Step into my office.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
You should feel like shit.
So've I.  Too much.
Top ten.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Why me?
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Okay... what about Strickland?
I intend to.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
You got froggy on me a couple times.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Your sex life?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
In LA?  Are you crazy?
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
She's my destiny.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
It was a tough call.
Why?
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
I'm not going.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Um... he was older.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
Let's take a look.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Hi. What's in the case?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Excuse me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What did he look like?
Put a BOLO out on that.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
We have another one.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
What I do requires confidentiality.
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I've been thinking about this.
Sue Ann Hanson.
Jaime? Where are you?
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Start killing people for real?
And you're working with him?
How are we going to find him?
I'll be back.
How's the arm?
So you went underground?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
Yes, sir.
Koessler?
I don't...
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You have to put things in perspective.
I know, I know.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Thank you, Nikki.
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
My pleasure.
You haven't told then, huh?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...Four days..?
Did you get it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Oh... right.
Why not?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
So I don't call either way.
It sucks.
I mean, I need the money.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Bud.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
...yeah, a month ago.
It's unbelievable.
I'll be your winger.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
So, what? Eleven?
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
We're going to Vegas.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
What?
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Vegas!
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
They're all skanks.
She smiled baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
You gotta do it.
Let's just leave.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
I gotta use the phone.
Christy was nice...
She was hot.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
She didn't like me, anyway.
That was different.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
Aww... He got away?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
Tomorrow?
No...
What was cold about it?
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
...it is so on.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
I'll be back with the coffee.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
An eye for an eye!
America has been good to me...
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Yeah.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Maybe less...
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
Yes.
And this?
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
No, I wanted other things for you.
What else do you believe in?
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Okay.  One minute.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
You really want to know?
You know I love spaghetti.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
He's coming over here!
And what do you want for Christmas?
I'm thinking about it.
When will I see you again?
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Until the old man tells me different.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
I do renounce them.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You just woke up!
I don't get it.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Okay.
It's just an undercoat. 
No, still here.
I met him in New York.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
What?
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Freddie?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Why?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
I guess.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
I just don't believe that!
I absolutely agree with Marge.
What does that mean?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I don't believe you.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
No glasses.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Which is?
Randall.
Right.
What?
Hello Meredith.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
What rumour?
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiancée...?
No!
31 people.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
I can believe that.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Really?
What did you do?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Well... mostly...
My God!
Huh?
Keep it.
Can I call you?
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
This is gotta be a game, right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
He's Black, OK?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
What's your real name?
I don't remember.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
Have you tried the telephone?
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Physical? Criminal?
No, I want long shifts.
So I hear.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Slow.
Yeah?
The taxi life, you mean.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
It's all I could think of.
Wrong.
Partners.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
I'm sorry.
My what?
Exactly.  And he got good.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
I'm not refuting anything.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Go ahead, son.
Well, son, you're home!
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
The Bijou?
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Ha!
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
The G-man?
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
No, sir.
I guess I did.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Huh?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Why not?
Yeah, well, that's enough.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
I can play the piano?
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Oh.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Cathy?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
No. Just a few hours.
Yes?
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
Then what was it?
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Oh, I suppose so.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Mmmm.
What name?
Okay.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
I'm simply quoting the law.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Where will we go?
Shhh. Shhh.
We won't be here.
Oh, thank you.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
What?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Oh.
Aren't these lovebirds?
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
Ahhh, but I know you.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Famished.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Do you expect me to believe...?
What do you want ?
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
So they united.
Hear, hear!
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What do you mean?
...everything I know.
What time is it?
Mitch...
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
For what purpose?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
If you don't even know what you want to do...
How?
Can we go on living here otherwise?
We need them.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Well? And are you not a good student?
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
We can't be sure of that.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
No.
It was a woman when we put her in.
I want it --
Don't call me that confounded name.
Afraid of what?
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
Get out of here!
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
We have never been friends.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
Yes.
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
"Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
The strip joint?
Keep that thing away from me.
What did they give you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
Someone else did it.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
You killed that cop Dutton.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
No. You don't.
Shut up.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Could say that.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
You mean Alex.
I mean Lauren.
He said he'd prove it.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
That was my first question.
Yes -- that is true.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I assure you such power exists.
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Professor Barnhardt.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
All right.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
Just Klaatu.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
Is it real?
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I want to know what he told you last night.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
But I suppose you know the answer.
How long will that take?
You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<u>Four</u> to go.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Where's Star, David?!
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Okay, okay.
You have a T.V.?
Good!
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
For what.
No.  I'm up.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Well, I...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Now you and David...
Let's go see them.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Why not?
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Even poor people have T.V.s
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
No.
No.  On the phone.
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Huh?...
Dogs don't eat each other.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Don't walk behind me.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Was dark... find a light...
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
The dogs?
Well, go on.
But...
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
That far?
Extinguishers.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
When do you think it got to him?
I had an accident.
What kind of stories?
No...
Around here.
Morlocks --
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
But you escaped.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes.
No, we created the Morlocks.
Why would you let me go back?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
No...
And why not?
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
Trust me...
Holding you... again.
All right...
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
We took a walk three days ago.
I have something for you...
Do you know you were humming?
I was not.
Nothing.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
His home.
Mm.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
All of you?
Thank you.
I don't understand.
You liked it there.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
It must have been safe.
You know this?
Someone you loved very much.
Is it?
I could...
Do you have it?!
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
No...
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
No, sir.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
My business?
And what does that mean?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Please...
Yeah.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
I don't know.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
Why?
Why would we do that?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
Is it true?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
I'll manage.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Why?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
That's certainly possible.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Oh, great.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
That sounds nice.
I'm a robber.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
What?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Maybe.
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Am I in trouble?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
What did Darryl say?
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
What happened?
Yes!  I believe I am!
Just past Boise City.
Before.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
What?!  What about him?!
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
Yeah.
Are you alright?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
We can change our names.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
It'd have to be pretty good.
What?!  What d'you think?!
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
What?!
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Good-looking?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Uh-huh.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Mints?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Ahh.
Pat Healy.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Well, I'll see ya.
Huh... that's strange.
Warren!
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
All you want is a phone number?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
You're a sick man, you know that?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Among others.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
What do you mean?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
And you met Mary how?
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Really? I never got a message.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Thanks.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Toy poodle!
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Okay.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Is that bubble what I think it is?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
What if I can't?
It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
We can't do that, Bobby.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
This is from the Highest Authority?
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
I, uh...
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Jesus Christ...
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Sioux Indian, right?
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Goodbye.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
I already did.
That's right.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
And get rid of the dog.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Why?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Watch out!
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
His spiritual mother...
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
What you call myths, we call our history.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Nothin'. Forget it.
Sorry.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
So they took care of Leo.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
We're going for The Stronghold.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
No. No, no. Thank you.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Lieutenant...
Uh hum.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
What about the plane?
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
. Yeah!
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
You don't have to do this.
What kind of games?
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
And that's one!
Well?
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
What is?
What?  What is it?
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Yawing right.
I know!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
But I have to!
Any more MiGs?
Like what?
Oh...I'll think of something.
Got you here.
No shit. The Iceman....
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I want him!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
I can't eject.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
That's because you don't have any women.
Who is the best.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Yes sir!
All right.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
Or you can quit.
You think I should quit?!
I'm nothing like him.
You may not think so, but you are.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
What was that?  An accident?
The Last Resort.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Do you expect me to believe you?
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Don't be an idiot.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
I don't know.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
You know I do.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
And you believe him?
Doug...
It's time you found out.
That a problem?
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I love you.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Some kind of mutation...?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
Roger that.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
My cannon.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Adios, bridge!
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
We need another plan.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
You are so full of shit...
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
What?
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
I have to talk to your brother.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Not necessarily...
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
We had a description of the suspect.
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
-- You found his mugshot?
I feel much better now.
Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
-- Me? Neither.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I embroidered.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
Racist asshole came at me.
...Okay...
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
Calls for speculation.
Badgering.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
-- Eddie told you?
-- Every word.
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
And you b-believe that.
Albert.
Tell me some other things about her.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Well, where are you going?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Smell something fishy, huh?
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Say no more.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
What do you mean?
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
How do you figure?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
Faulty wiring.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Donna, you are a muffin.
Maybe.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I can't tonight.
Everything, but everything.
When he finds out.
It's a school night... back by nine.
A special friend?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Look at this finger here.
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
You know what that would mean?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
I...
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
I thought I would need it.
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
You may step down.
I'm going to uphold that.
We went to Code Blue...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Tell us.
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
'Code Blue'...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Why?
The most respected...
Who told you that?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
One hour.
Yes.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
That's perfectly all right.
Listen to me, fella...
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
And what makes you so tough?
No.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
...I know. I went...
Where is he?
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
...Gruber's not bad.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
I can't talk now.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
The Hospital...?
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
As I've said we had some more...
Should I?
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Sure...get in!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
They'll probably move at dawn.
It was nearer than that.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
The nightmares.
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Chase...
Hasn't been another call, has there?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
I'll be there in three hours.
Diabetes?
No.
Is he all right?
Oh my God...
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
I'm fine.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
The car's no there yet?
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
They wouldn't let me...
What's that?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
I am about this.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
No, I can't.
He does.
What's the difference?
Is it true Phil?
Look, I just better go.
Fine.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
He's a big boy.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
That's enough.
I couldn't do it.
What is it... the secret?
It seems we're short on singers.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
Son of a bitch!!
Then keep your mouth shut.
Up you go.  Right now.
I don't know...
He climbed when he was ready.
What makes you so sure it was one?
May I ask you something?
Then what are you trying to say then?
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
When did you talk to Lula?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Why should it?
What'd you say?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Hasta siempre.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
You ain't actin', mama.
And?
Stab it and steer.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
What'd you say to her?
I guess.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
I do.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Who do?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
Under a hundred.
You knew my daddy?
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
Fan works.
Sailor?
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
I'll come along.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I mean tomorrow.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
SAILOR!!!!
Damn!
Just a place.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Take care of him?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Yes.
On one condition...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Where we goin'?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Whattya mean?
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
I know... I remember.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
I thought you were tinkering.
He finished it Winter Break.
He is. Take my word for it.
Not Curtis.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He heard everything we were saying.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Kidnapped? By who?
Maybe... I don't know.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
What's to tell?
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
He was never able to reproduce them.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
Sounds like a good one.
It's not bad.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
That's really it.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
But... ?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Hm.
Well done, James.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
I never heard of it.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Amazing.
How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Oh. Well. I...
Grady!
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
You got me.
All right.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
And what did you say?
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
What's that?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Maybe I should read it.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
Why did you come here, Grady?
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
That's all right. We'll find him.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Something wrong with that?
I'm working on it.
Yeah. It's really nice.
Then what? What?!
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
It's a bright sound.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Were you watching me?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Well... not in the common way.
Why don't you just tell me?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I was asleep.
I went to bed around seven.
I'd say you're moving.
I count my blessings.
I'm adjusting okay.
Apartment's okay.
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
How do you know?
I know because... it's just something I know.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
What?
A diary?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Then think about it.
It's okay.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
I don't feel anything.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.
Will I ever be normal?
You couldn't say.
I want you to calm down.
Go home, Walter.
I don't see --
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
It's fucking freezing out here.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Guess I'm not like most women.
I'm just quiet.
I thought you were a dyke.
I'll buy a plant.
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
What?
So... what's your dark secret?
The worst?
Molested little girls?
Yeah.
Depraved? My mistake.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Why young girls, Walter?
Us seeing each other.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
No way that could just be seawater.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
But what did he see that made him panic?
It's trying to communicate.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
FUCK LOGIC!!
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Copy that.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
This one is gorgeous.
Then why don't you try it on?
No, Dad, it isn't.
You already know what they are.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
That seems to apply to you also...
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
No.
Are you joking?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Aren't you going to change?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
But for what reason should I come there?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
We'll try again.
Here I am.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
And what did they say about me?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Thank you.
Yes, we will.
Through someone else?
Why?
It's a sin to be fat.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Why?
No.
Why?
Yes, Mother.
Say it!
I love you.
At least once a week.
In the confessional.
Would you like to talk about it?
And then what?
Where'd it come from before that?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
One.
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
You'll laugh.
Why not?
A mistake...
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Everything... I don't have children.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Are you intelligent?
And why am I here?
Of what?
Of telling you.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Because I was afraid.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
I have to throw up...
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Do you remember what just happened?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes who did you see?
I don't remember.
H... how?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
I can beat that.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
The science of psychiatry.
What's your opinion?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
She stopped eating completely...
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
The Catholic Church...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
And what has that to do with it?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Even Christ would partake socially.
Do you think they ever existed?
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For Agnes.
The father!
This is insane.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
That's a lie.
No!
I doubt that's what she'd say.
What happened to the baby?
Eh?
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Eight and two thirds.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
What they like?
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
They'll be here.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
No. I don't.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I beg your pardon?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Oh aye, but I thought ...
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
What's that mean?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
Yes.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Is there a fire, then?
Eh?
He can talk then?
I'll look after meself.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
So's mine.
What's old got to do with it?
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
No.
Well you're not going.
Now, look here, Norm ...
What?
Well, you look like him.
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Aye, but you know him well.
Oh, leave off!!!
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
I know, that's the trouble.
And they want me?
I feel like shit...
Hell, we're equipped --
Or something will be able to see us.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
I'll see what I can do.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
God I'm hungry.
A transmission?
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Right.
What?
I kind of like it.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
He's running a fever.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Oh... God...
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
We sure need this flamethrower.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
You lead.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
What is it?
Yes, thank heaven.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Let's be democratic.
By eating our food supplies.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Better tell the boss.
What's happening?
Too many.
Keep trying!
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Nooooo!
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
What?
What's wrong?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Thanks.
What is that?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
What can I do?
Give me a yell is something happens.
And what is your name?
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Eddie what?
You take charge.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Aren't you?
We're?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Yes, you did. You still do.
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Yes, Addison.
Yes, Addison.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Then you two must have a long talk-
Naturally enough, your understudy.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
That's nice.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Then you're crazy.
I love you...
What?
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
For instance - you!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
The audition.
Who?
Gone.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
It's not nonsense.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
What would you like? Texas?
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
You know what I'm going to be?
I don't have to. I want to.
Every day.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
You think?
Find out.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
She works hard.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Don't be dense. The party.
What for?
You probably won't believe me.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Oh, no. I see the play.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.
Of course.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
Well...
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
Eve?
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute!
Nothing...
- and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
That was way back...
What is he talking about?
How do you mean?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
That's right, but I don't understand-
Play it again.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Well...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Are you breaking the contract?
Answer my question!
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
We need a sympathetic face.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
When?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
--we will--
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
You want me to be the bastard.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I haven't said anything--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
We're inside the White House now.
It's nothing personal, though. 
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
I'm so glad.
When did he hire you?
Tell that to Muskie.
Chapin did contact you then?
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Give me your checkbook then.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Who by?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
--what do you think?--
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Talk about Segretti--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
The C.I.A.
Are you sure?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
Nobody ever had too much.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Absolutely.
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
Haldeman.  Right?
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Stifler told me.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Yeah, that's right.
You think she was serious?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
That's stupid.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
I'm not going.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Dad!!
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Don't you want me to?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Okay.
I suppose that would be okay.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
You think so?
Kevin, this is serious!
Not for you.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
How?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Okay.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
That's the spirit.
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Fuck yeah we will.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Doing what?
Would you shut up?
Yeah. Apparently.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
And who's Claude?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
It's okay. I can see fine.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I know. He told me.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Andy...
No... I...
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Because Gaston was after it.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
What were you showing her?
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Yes, your highness.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
What happened to your parents?
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
I have my reasons.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
I'm sorry.
Anya... where are we?
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Ah! Let us begin!
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
No. Empress, you --
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Alvy.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Well, no... not just, not only.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
Your grammy!
You sure?
Fifteen years?
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Why not?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
No.
M'hm.
M'hm.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
You are extremely sexy.
You- Do you love me?
Do I love you?
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
I dunno.
Of course.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yes, it is.
Yeah.
You followed me!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Holy cow!
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Check it out.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Yeah.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
I have a headache.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Stop calling me Max.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
Yeah. Right.
SO?
You think so? Do you really?
I just have time to get the, uh-
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
No, no, no, not at all.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
It was a wonderful set.
Yeah.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
What?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Well, probably.
Really?
Count on it.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Can I open it?
When does he graduate high school?
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
And?
She's in ICU.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.
Forget it, Judy.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Not as a rule.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel?
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
It's taken care of.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
What are you saying?
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Don't do this!
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I have no idea who you are.
Sure.
Yes.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And you know, he really does not.
And Ryan works at home.
I will treasure this.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Okay.
Lemon it is.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Come here.
I'm so sorry.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Not good.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I'm not going to leave you alone.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Yes.
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Are you lovesick?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Yes.  Fine.
I never like to talk about my work.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
What are they?
Relax.  You've done enough.
And here they are!
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
The both of you.
Well good.  Thank God.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
Of course --
Yes...he's wonderful...
Barbatus?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Yes, what else?
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Care to make a small wager?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Would you like to?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
How come?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
I forgive you.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
No -- I like it.
Much better.
Why?
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
I don't understand --
No -- I don't want anything.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Was he really upset when you told him?
Do I have to?
Would you mind opening the window?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Oh.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Last night?
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Oh?  Oh!
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
What do you mean, sorry?
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Let me get my bag.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Sure.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
Aren't you?
What's this -- you packing?
Still stuck on her, huh.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Kubelik.
I don't know.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Yes, I know.
Let me take that.
That's right.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Stop that, Fran.
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
It won't happen again.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
Esprit de corps --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby what?
What is this?
Rangers, eh?
Sort of.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Sometimes.
A long time.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Why they call you that?
What are you doing out here?
How?
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
I don't know.
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
I know.
Yeah, I know.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Anyone got a cigarette.
We ain't goin' down the river.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Captain?
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
What about an American named Kurtz?
Thank you, sir.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
What?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Haiphong.
When did you hear?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Yes.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
I know.
Anyone got a card?
Well , who's in command here?
Son of a bitch, sir.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
139  CONTINUED:
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
157  CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
How did she..?
Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
Wait a second.
So what's the problem?
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
I don't plan on dying.
Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
Yeah?
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
You don't feel cold?
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Nothing personal.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Uh-huh.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
No.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I see the help -- judgement call.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
You all set here?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Just how grateful I am.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Lovely.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
One baked -- one fries.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
All right, cut me a break.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Last word freak.
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Terrify me?
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Oh, my gosh.
You consider your life easy.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
What's it mean?
Right.
So you're from around here?
What is this?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
We both know what you were doing.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
Take us there.
I know.  It was a joke.
One hour per man.
Yeah.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Ten million --
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
He wants to kill you?
Why?
Why didn't you finish this game?
Why not?
Because you are a women.
After that?
What?
Oh.  What do you think about?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Taiwan.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
That means you won't have a gun.
I don't believe that.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
How do you know they're not?
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
No?
And you were drilling these holes...?
What?
Why?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
When did it start?
Why?
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Everyone regrets something.
Sometimes.
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Sure.
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
I hope not.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Right.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
You mean quit?
How would you like the funds?
Thank you.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
And put it on expenses?
Tell them we're working for the University.
They'll never get us.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
Why don't we go together?
I fell in love.
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
Huh?
Lucky break!
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Doug?
No!
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
What?
What? You are crazy!
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
So, we won't be going to London?
No way Doug, I can't.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
There's nothing there for me.
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.
Can we charge admission?
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Don't worry. Thanks.
About forty minutes.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Deal!
Sometimes.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
'Bout what?
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
Were you with Jamie?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
Later.
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Know so.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
In 76 years, me neither.
Yeah --
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
That sounds like horseshit.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Fun.
You're sometimes not sure?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Where?
What would you do up here?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
I'm not applying to college.
I'm sick.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Nothing.
Now? We just --
I don't want to come here anymore.
Better. I was really angry.
Dad --
No. I want what's best for you.
Lead man.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Praying.
For the focuser?
Please.
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
That's good.
Uh, thanks...
Uh, hi....
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
But he didn't ask me.
Coming, Eileen...
No!
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Huh?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
March 11th.
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
So what? We'd be rich!
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
You were ringing the doorbell!
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Well, he's gone.
Yeah.
She plays the clarinet, too.
Okay.
You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
I mean it.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
But it would hurt.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
I can look and see.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
He was nervous.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
I'm serious.
No.
Sure.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Yes.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
It's mine all right.
Beats me.
Wanta sue me?
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Same one you had yesterday?
The door's locked.
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Pretty terrible shot.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Absolutely.
I have a radio fix...
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary – Bill and I are... I love. We-
No, no –
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
Well... actually, no Bill...
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Are you all right?
Ever act?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
What do you do far a living?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Well, you just... sound a little–
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Pictures! Jesus!
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
What do I write about?
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
Are you sure –
Hold on –
What do you think happened?
I believe you – I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
The others are being sent.
Yeah.
What do you do, Fink?
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Home. Watching TV.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Who?
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
I thought you hardly know her.
I had him in two classes.
I know who you are.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I have nothing to hide.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Why not?
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
No, thanks.
Didn't you study it in school?
I like you.
Why not?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
No.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I never have before.
Try me.
No.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
I went over last night, too.
Why not?
Catherine told me what was in it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
And you volunteered.
I'm sure.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
He was shot.
I'm a painter, too.
I don't know.
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Ten bucks apiece.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Who?
No.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
What do you mean?
Decipher?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
What are they?
You mean like an ape?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
Very well.
Out?
Use your fucking instinct.
Who am I?
Your people.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
You don't have any fucking money..
Hi.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Would you check out my studio some time?
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
You're a fast mover.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
What time is it?
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I just don't think you're being fair.
Uh-oh!
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
And the truth frightened her?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Yes?
That, sir, does not compute.
Pheromones?
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
You are going back to school.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Keep it.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Umm-hmmmm.
She knows who we are.
From the other side of the equator-
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Dear daisy, don't despair.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
What do you mean?
Well, I can respect your opinion.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Hardly a worry, sir.
He ran away?
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
My life's an open book. You read?
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
La'chiem.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
To kill me.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Touchy, touchy.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Who is it?
...You gonna kill me?
You're a genius.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Odd desire for anyone.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I wish you'd...
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Tom Jones?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Right first time.
Ahm.....
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Well, there is that ...
Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
Who knows?
Uh, ten uh...
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
Two hours.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
Wait.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Give or take a year.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Can you scare them off?
No, wait!
I think so.
Good girrrl!
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother's...
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
I don't know.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I will.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Thank you, Robert.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
I wish he were here...
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Would you care to take it, sir?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Your family doctor?
Hello, Eve.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
He does...?
Your leg must be getting better.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Hello, Eve.
Thank you, Eve.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Thank you.
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
I understand.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I want to tell Eve.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
... Sir?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
I agree.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Yes sir - elevator!
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
I am a very serious gardener.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
No.
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
That could be possible...
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
The monkey.
I was worried.
I have to go back now.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
You've always loved the animals.
Us, of course.
Yes.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
I love you so much.
A better friend.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Emily Dickinson.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Who told you?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
No. Don't be an ass.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
But I think I have another plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Forget it.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Count me in.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
No, I didn't know that.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
I have to see you.
Did you see the reviews?
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh, Lotte...
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
He's a selfish bastard.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You still know.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
You remember Halle.
and she is mine...
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
She gone like they say?
Thank you.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
What run him off? Tell me that!
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Yes sir.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
It's the LeBaron.
Uh-huh.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
I was bowling--
Huh?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
It's already posted.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
I've had a--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
And was there anything of value in the car?
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Far from it.
Mm.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Huh?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
And please don't call her my mother.
Uh-huh.
Finder's fee?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
But he's--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Hey Walter--
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Calmer than you are.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Yeah.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Have it your way.  The point is--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
"Our" car, Walter?
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
What about the toe?
Dude--
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
What's your point, Dude?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
You know this!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
He can't walk, Walter!
They shot Donny!
Then what's...
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
Dude, I'm sorry--
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
...Us? DUDE
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Huh?
Fuckin' A.
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Well. . . yeah.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Nothing.
What about Nomak?
You don't have to hunt to do it.
For what?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Blood...
Thought you were dead.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
I don't know about this, man --
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Don't even start, old man.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
I don't buy it.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
"The Blood Tide".
I'm sorry, I --
Look closer.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Then what is it?
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
Go on, I'll be fine!
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
He killed them?
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
Join the club.
--Anna--
Sometimes. Where are we going?
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Let's talk to your husband--
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
Not the only things missing, Nick.
Oh, sorry, right.
--Nick!!
It's like traveling back in time.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
--fine, later, fine.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
--you should get back into bed.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
Whatever you want.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
Both. Now.
No.
Try a long walk.
--Cotter: shut up.
Fucking owl!
Down there in the Park.
For "James?"
--who?
This isn't about us.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
At least you still have the tapes.
--and we brought it back with us!
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
She's far from "fine."
Anna--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
...Huh?
What'd he say?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Going out with Meurice.
I own the place.
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Back where?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Yeah.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
How long did you watch her?
Got a job for you.
Right.
Meurice...
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
You did? A human ear?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
Yes, but.
If you want to.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
No way.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
See my breasts?  . See?
Yes, I like you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Yeah. hurry up though.
Falling.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Are you a bad boy?
You. what?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Yeah. Good bye.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
Yeah.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Okay, Sandy.
Goodnight.
What am I going to do?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Jeffrey?. Why?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Really?
Frank!!
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
This is it.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
... Stop it Mike.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Yes, I am.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
I see.  How much?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
For calling you a homo.
Ah, yes.  The murder.
Because I got caught.
Because they caught me?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Coke.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Oh, I see.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Keep them coming.
Diego?
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Not mad.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Good.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Figured what out?
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Do I know you?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Put that shit away, they're here.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Kristina's fine.
George, he wasn't asking.
How are you doing?
You mean, like a trip?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
Sail.
Don't move, Hacene.
It's true.
What's happened to you?
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
Why?
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
The official cause?
That's what my report will read.
No.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
No -- never.
Counsel approach the bench.
You can't show intent.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
I assume his girlfriend.
No -- never.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.
About a year and half ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- several times.
Cocaine.
I was angry.
You called him?
That's enough.
Oriental medicine.
Why does she come to you?
What did you prescribe for her?
Yes.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
Do you remember his exact words?
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
That bastard!
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Yes.
You didn't know about it before that?
No further questions.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Something like that.
How?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Tastes can change.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
You can see me now.
Are you scared?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You don't need anybody.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Mr. Roston?
I can back it up.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It's more involved than that.
It didn't get there from me.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Why are there two deeds here?
Mom's orders.
Lawyer here?
He's not coming.
What?!
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
'82.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I never knew that.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Carolyn!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Heat is heat.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Yeah.
Francesca. Robert.
I thought it was funny.
I feel so embarrassed.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
When?
What?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Woman friends, too?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No, I'm just saying --
What made you ask such a question?
I would love to come for dinner.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
No, I don't mind.
What were your parents like?
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about your husband?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Frannie.
What's her name?
Apparently just before her death.
WHAT!
Hell no!
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
What the hell you talking about?
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Just try it.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
But.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
You know I can't.
All the more reason I should be here.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Here!
Let me see it.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
I didn't sell it.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
It was just like in my head.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
What's that, Johnnie?
Open the case!
You don't need a key.
Where is it?
Yeah, I know.
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
No!
What the fuck is going on?
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
That doesn't make any sense.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
Violet, I won't let you leave.
Caesar, this is crazy.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
What happened to them?
You need the money just like we do.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Oh, right.
Five.
Another time.
Lick me.
No.
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
How do I know you are cops?
...  thank you.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Good guess.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Sure.
A beer.  Of course.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
How did you meet him?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
I think ...
Yeah.
Does the case lock?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
That's his brother.
Yeah.
Trust me, Violet.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
What happened?
I was so afraid you ...
No.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
I thought you were never going to do that.
And what if I couldn't do that?
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
Why?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
Jason...  They can't let you go...
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
You are a friend of his?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
I hadn't heard.
For twenty thousand dollars.
What if I say no?
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
We're about an hour away.
I don't remember any of this.
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
You knew he was coming.
xxxxxx
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
He run away often?
I'm sorry.
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
I fixed it myself.
What have you done to my flat?
...elephoned sir.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Layton.
He will be pleased when he comes home.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Not really, no.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Why?
Take her off the list.
We don't make mistakes.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
You're joking.
It's not our mistake!
Really.
Tuttle?
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I know that.
I did it for you.
You want to take my console into your office?
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
What do they want you or?
No ...
Stressed? He's psycho.
Sleeping in the back.
Got a beer?
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
What did you say?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
He's better.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
No, no.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Thanks.
I need a drink, that's all.
What's wrong.
That's too many.
Backup?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I'll drink to that.
You can't leave me now.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
How can that be? He was getting better.
I've taken that into consideration.
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Let me think.
That's ridiculous.
You really think so?
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Call if you get weird.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
As good as humanly possible.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Did it really go well?
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Your hair's a little funny.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Stop it.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Yes.
I'll speak to you soon
Yes, there is.
Yes.
Follow me.
You talked me into it.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
One's enough.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Yes, sure.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Yeah?
Okay.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Oh, good.
Me!
This is hysterical.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
Well, when?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
I already told you I'm not.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Me too.
There there...
Are you ready?
Why not?!
What?
When did you make this, Walter?
Leonard, what are you doing?
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Enough already about it - get to work!
I don't have another cat!
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
You're like an undercover guy!
Huh?!!!
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Gee.  Thanks.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Litter, yeah!
We hate you guys!
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
Probably.  What movie is this?
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Hi.
So I noticed.
You weren't home.  Like always.
You guys are thrashed.
Hi there.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Water.  Okay.
Not exactly.
Where are you gonna go?
Yeah?
I know.
Who?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Cafe Blase.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Am I in trouble or something?
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
Cramps?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Oh.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
I...
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
Not if you're careful.
How can you keep doing this?
I can't work this.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Got that.
Oh, baby!
But --
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Like you've got a grip.
What?
Catch?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
He did?
--but you're father's in there!
I got lured.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'll learn.  C'mon--
What do you believe in?
G'night.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
And now you wanta teach me?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Annie, I think you should leave.
What's it say?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
You missed him!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
Naw...
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Take the first shot at me.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It's a damn convention.
Where does he go?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Liar.
You were wandering around.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
Philip, if you would rise.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
That's right.
I don't know.
Ohhh...
Eight.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You lost your control.
I lost control?
Yeah.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
She came to talk to me...
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I just told you. She called me.
No, I'm not okay.
Yeah, she's here.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...and she doesn't always -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Nice to see you, Senator.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
It's chinchilla.
Oh, fabulous.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
Why do you need that much?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
With what?
I put her to bed.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Just wait there for me!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
Green?
No, Sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.
What?
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
I understand.
Can I go in?
...fuckin' jerk-off.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
Uh-huh.
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
We can't help him if -
Fine, fine.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Of course, Remo.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Ma che cazzo!
Mm.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Yeah.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
He gives a fuck what I do?
What? What?
I don't - 
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
Yeah.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Get lost?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I am.
Lester - he called you here.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
This is Nick.
Pleasure.
It's up to you.
So are we.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
They'll do it.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
No, no, no, no!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
I'm positive.
You are right. What can I...
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
I suppose she does.
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Wha-at?
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
What about "climbing in?"
Well. I stand corrected.
I still have one left...
You can't get away with..
Whatever you say...Sis.
Did you just say "girls?"
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
Stop.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
I'll let you know.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Any place.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
You could've made me lose my call.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
It's taken care of.
Make a "U" and go back.
Any minute.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
What about the others?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
That's not her.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
What bank?
You can't give up.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Are you okay?
You're all three of you in that van?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
Do you have to point that?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Why are we stopping?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Naturally.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Twenty percent.
Some loyalty.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Just relax.
I don't know what you mean.
I still don't see you.
And not a nickel.
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Are you busting my chops or what?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Is that good or bad?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
You fucking did.
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
How'd you guess?
And what's it like?
Must be.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
The things a girl has to put up with.
I'm thinking of your man.
I have to talk to her, Col --
Don't call me that.
Never said a truer word.
Sure I do.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I know that.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
A little.
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
You following me?
You promise?
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
What condition?
Jimmy?
It was you...
Let them come then.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More what?
Anything.
Tell me what she wore.
Thirty-five.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know her, Jimmy?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Can't.
He's all right.
My pleasure.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Why would you do that?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
I know that.
Good.
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
So it's on the street.
So, what do I look like?
Kill me.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
She your wife?
These things take time, Fergus.
Why?
Don't be so sure.
Depends on what you believe in.
It's as simple as that?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
How can I?
No.
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
You never know.
People. They could be looking.
You're crazy --
It's lovely.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Well -- come on.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Where's that airlines bag?
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
No!
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
We? You mean you're --?
Very sweet.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Barely, yes.
May I have a cigarette, please?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
No.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
You'd lie about anything.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Then who does?
Or you --  Or you --
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
Alexander.
I'm not fifteen.
What are you doing?
I'll be right there.
Maybe.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
In money.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
The kid said --
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I'm very cold.
I'm very confused.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
And this? And this?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
I don't know -- how would I know?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Peter Joshua.
Good for you.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
How did you find out?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Starting tonight?
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
What?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Ça alors! From Charles?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
The American Embassy.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Oh la vache!
We want that money -- now!
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
So?
It won't happen again.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No?
She's underage.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
You're not?
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
You know about that too?
Then you should go.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Why?
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Especially not your dad.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Follow me.
I heard you got attacked.
You know I want to go with you.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I do not.
Yes!
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Yeah.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Yeah. Who is she?
What?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Yes.
NO!
You can't bring it.
I'm not leaving it here.
You're being unfair.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
Huh?
I need your truck.
I need your help.
And if that Elvis shit...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Shut...
Do you wanna give me a minute?
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
You stole this truck.
...-damn!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
Take your gun!
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!


 Yeah...
I did not steal the truck.
...truck!
Oh, shit.

...Shift.

Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...wanna give it a try!
Whoo!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
 


...you're dealin' with!
What?
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Oh, no!
 Yeah.
...hospital.
We got two paddles.
Yeah, baby!
Bring him down!
Put your hand in my pants.



Come here.
...-ful?!
...here comes the...
Come on.  Come on.

We got-...

...truck that kept Elvis cool?
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
 Yeah.
No.
Be cool.  Be--
Three seconds.  One...

And it won't be pleasant. 
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 

You-You can't let him...
  Hey, actually...
He's the dude...
...owe you.
Exactly.
...including the permanently extreme.
...to be off the island tonight.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
You look fit...healthy...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
I'll do it.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY
Check it out.
This was supposed to be a...
Move!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...noon.
Mornin'.
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Iced coffee.
I beg your pardon?
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
...the river.



...it.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
All right.  Enough. Look...
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-time. 
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...like a fish.
...is a perfect hunter.
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
...Mason?
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...tunnel!
...public drunkenness....
...to talk, son.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
Jesus.
I'll lead 'em out.
...-damn phone.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
Take it easy, Jake.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Probably.
I think I gave it to her.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Very.
What for?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Was he right?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
No.
How did you find out?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
She's fine.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Of course I do. Where are you?
What's that, Curly?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
No thanks.
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Okay.
How'd you get past the guards?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Didn't you call?
And why's that?
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
They only dump the water at night.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Of course.
Yes.
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
It wasn't much of a lie.
But he wasn't killed.
That your maiden name?
No, not for that one.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Why?
Doing what?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
You didn't tell me.
Give me an example.
It's possible.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's not tied up!
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
What the hell is this all about?
...no...
Don't know her. Take a number.
Okay.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Of course.
I don't understand.
Do you know me?
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
...Yes of course.
But I have to know.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
No, you have a press agent do it.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
Why? What do you mean?
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
No...
Then where's the money?
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
That's a long story.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
Certainly not.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -

I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
Is it good?
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
No.
Toothache.
Hmm!
In the water.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Half past eleven.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
What're you going to do, Charlie?
Yes?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
She's going to leave you -
Brad, you are drunk.
Are you finished?
It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
It's a letter from her lawyers.
How do you do, Charles?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
How long have you been smoking?
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
I think you'd better leave now.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
Just now.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
There's more, isn't there?
You lie.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
You have a better suggestion?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Who doesn't?
Was it you?
Well, he missed!
Are you open?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
She called me.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
I'm talking to myself here.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
I guess not.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
I know.
I don't back down.
You know what pisses me off the most?
Sorry.
You've got a customer.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Number six.
Why not?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
That's embarrassing?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Who found him?
I want to rent a movie.
And this is what you rented?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way!
You're lying.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Fuck you.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
I'll call you. Let you know.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
You used to go out with her?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
She's my girlfriend.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Why did you agree to come in then?
What were you doing up so late?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Really?
I was kidding.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
How many what?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Why do you say that?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Um. Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
Thank you for being rational.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
What?
I didn't do that!
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
He is.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I'll see you there.
I have first dibs.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I admit, I can be bought.
I copy.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
I did what I thought was right.
Fine, I guess...
Nice and easy...
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Just hangin' out.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
You couldn't.
Did I miss something?
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
I can't believe you just said that.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
Half a day.
Who's going with you?
Do you always transport through the air?
Then go fetch.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Great, sir. Great.
And you, sir?
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
What would you like to know, sir?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
I beg your pardon?
Do you feel that way now?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
I did, sir.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Where is he now, sir?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Keeping fit then?
Aye.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Yes, sir.
Vitamins will it be then?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Oh.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Yes.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Sir.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Thank you.
What?
Sixth is faster.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Bottega.
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I'm sorry.
Twenty five?
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Elvis?
No harm done, ma'am.
Vincent...
I'm standing right here.
What happens if you don't?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Max.
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
The trunk?
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
Yeah.
I'm trying...
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
So?
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
Collateral damage.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
She's in the hospital.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
The man who hired me for this contract.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
You get benefits?
No.
No, not just that.
That's the reason?
Slow down.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Drop me off here!
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
Switch the charts.
What?
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
Pretty scary, huh?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
How is it possible?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Connecticut.
Then tell me what happened.
Why not?
They'll trace it.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Without a love of my own.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
-- Understood.
Tell me about it.
No.  Not yet.
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
There's no plug to pull.
He died...  ... in 1972.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
No, thanks.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
It'll just take a moment.
What would you have me say, David?
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Well --
A third layer.
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
But what do I say?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Can you help us?
The librarian... or the library...?
What kind of deal?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Sounds like a Russian general.
-- I'm moving to Washington.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
That you, Valerian?
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
What'd you think?
It's getting late...
Please --
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
But --
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Buck is a deal.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Git to work!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
So then you just call him.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
He's gonna be awright.
Innocent?
Fifty's a nice round number.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
You just said he could eat anything.
Oh my. Oh my... Give it back here!
That fool. That damn fool.
Call.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
He was lying.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
I never hurt nobody...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
She's supposed to have it.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
For months... last October.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Then what do you need me for?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
I'll get a locksmith.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Michael Johnson.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Don't ever forget how good you are.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Look at her legs.
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
Helen... excuse me, we...
I said you were...
Good.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
That's always your privilege, sir.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Helen Hudson...
Because I think I'm wrong.
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Are you still involving me in your crash?
Hard to say.
Yes.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
I'd have to see it on.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Do you think I should?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Not even if it's something positive?
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
Don't be ridiculous.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
Home free.
List schmist. You'll remember.
No.
Steak?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
The restaurant, too?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
How about a dance?
It wasn't exactly a lie.
You should go.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
I think we need to talk about some things.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
Michael.   Yes.
I think I've heard this speech before.
What does that mean?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
It's Elvis...
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I guess we're going to find out.
How about if I call you?
Thank you.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
You want Zero to kill him?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
No?
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
I will.
I've got a way with people.
I'm from Belgium.
We had a deal.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
You said don't do it, boss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go look.
You can use my car.
What is it you do, Sami?
I see.   A master criminal.
I'm the driver.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Glenmorangie.
Tonight.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
You ask a lot of questions.
You got it in a bar?
After last night I could say the same for you.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Then leave her to me.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
I do as I please.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
You don't seem to understand.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
You're too young to understand.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Never!
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Fine.
You were enlightened?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
What have you discovered?
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
Then, why did you come?
She needs direction... and training.
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
I'm buying.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
Oh.
I don't know you.
Murderer.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Victims.  Aren't we all.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
I can see her.
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
"Our" Crow...?
I don't think so.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Forever.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Great book.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
I never said that.
I said I was sorry.
I'm busy.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Of Human Bondage.
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Okay.
What are you scared of?
It was nothing.
Well what then?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
He'll love it.
I was just kidding.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
I told you to lock the door.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Ronald?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Loser.
Okay.
Shhh.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Cecile.
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
So? How'd it go last night?
Where is she?
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
I'm not in the mood.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Well done.
Fine! Get off me!
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
War it is.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Black.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
She's not here.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
I did?
Oh... no thank you...
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Sometimes.
The Farren house
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
Yes, darling,
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I live right here.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where is that?
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
This is more fun than just pretend.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
I want to touch it.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
That's a fine-looking ring.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
But she's such a nice lady.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Come away, Amy.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Good. Except for PMS.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
And my bra finally fits again.
My vision got worse again.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Ignore it.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
I think I already have.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
About Mark? Carlton?
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
So pee? Here?
Yeah right... You better go.
I'm working on it...
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
A little.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Intriguing?
I can forgive you a bestseller.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Briefs.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
What are they for?
No. I was doing my laundry.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No, I got it. It's okay.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
I love you too.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
No, it was our first date.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
What kind of animal?
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Spinning backwards?
Yes.  This way.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Sorry, sir.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Good.
Why, yes.
Well be more careful, please.
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Tell me about them...
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
I'm...  being...  punished.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Right.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Bob...
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Oh.  Excuse me.
Three years.
I don't think so.
Bob...
What I told him to?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I'm not sure.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
We vetoed that?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Yeah.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
No.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
I don't mind.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Hi.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
All set.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
What?
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
It's because of me.
No, sir.
What'dya get?
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Hey, this is great.
Well?
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
What is the point?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
Oh come on, Pitts...
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
But...
what?!
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Meeks.
I didn't know you taught.
Courtyard?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
YAWP!
AHHHHHH!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
I don't know.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
What?
I... I just don't want to come.
A play, dummy.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Er  No.
Oh..
This play?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
What the hell are you talking about?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Not an option.
Dead.
Self sufficient...
The "come back" kind.
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
He's not coming...
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
Joey...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
How does an island sound to you?
Joey...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
Good... Pass the beer.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Fuckin' A!
Yeah, Sal--
Well... you remember Cynthia?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Jesus!
Nick...
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Where is he???
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Not so good.
No?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Linda, Linda...!
Would you?
Sure.
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
You're going hunting?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
We... Three bullets.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Right here.
So do I.
Fucking A.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
From Nam?
Forget Sal.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Sit down.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
No.
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
Where?
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
Never one.
Yeah.
Technothugs?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
I can smell it.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Fuck you - fuck you.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
Ooops, I forgot.
Yes.
But Sergeant...
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Pass.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
...Have you been drinking?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
No you don't.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
Good to know you, Willy.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
Of course I will.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
Guess there will, if it says so.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
No! No! I won't.
All right, darling.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Some other time, Stevens.
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Well, I'll be -- 
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
Well, I --
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
How much?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez!
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Tired?
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Jabez!
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
What's that?
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
What does he want?
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
When you're hot, you're hot.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Oh, yeah, I will...
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
I gotta listen to it if they think...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
I don't have a choice.
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
What do you want to know that for?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
... armed robbery ...
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Okay ...
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
Mulvaney...
No you don't.
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
You were terrific, too!
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
I want him to think that.
Get over there!
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Okay.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
Okay.  Which one goes?
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
How much?
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT
Where is the money?
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Be kind to your sitter.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
He said... take his right arm.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Twice a night, sometimes.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
I thank you.
I didn't.
What makes Sammy run?
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
What are you so worked up about?
He's just being nice.
He's completely innocent.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
Motherfucker you.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
Do I have to spell it out?
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Christmas came early.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Before I get off work.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Shit!  I forgot.

I am a man.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?

I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I love you, my brother.

Tell Vito.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Yeah, I think.

What?
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
What? No! Look.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Me too!
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Me, me, me!
But my mom gave me the map.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Try one in a million!
So can I come along?
You mean the lunch room?
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, go on.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Me too. I'm almost there.
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Uh-oh. Harry?
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey can be on top?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
I think you'll make a good teacher.
And...?
What?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
With your permission...
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Yes.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
My Lord?
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Yes...
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
MOTHER! Tell me!
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
No.  I never drink -- wine.
YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
I predict we're lost.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Dracula?
Let me take you to the hospital.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
I was thinking about killing myself.
Formaldehyde.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Eddie, how was I?
Rolling.
What do you mean?
And who may you be?
Boris Karloff!?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
It takes me comfortable.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Hruphh...?
Would that work?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Bela died.
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
Uh, atomic energy?
Dynamite --
The poor girl's out of a job.
Huh?!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
You don't wanna be noticed?
I don't know.
You know, to make the legs move --
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
Who?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.
No.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
I want you to take this.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
What?
So he killed himself.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
She could've been a nurse.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Ma...
Well, when will she be back?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Our foibles, our foibles!
Never would be plenty.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Why do it?
Dynamite.
So?
Leave. Go.
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Yeah, well...
The what?
Oh yeah.
Saturday, I think we should
... yeah, then, but...
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Come on, let's go.
Okay.
No. It's your fault.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
You watching the ballgame?
Yeah.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I was in jail.
What...
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
In love?
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
But you haven't written your novel.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
You guys have fun?
Thanks, Mr. M.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Would you sign it for me?
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
Door was open.
points at the motel.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I'm not like you.
So?
For what?
What do you mean?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Hell, good luck!
Yeah.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Yes.  But do you know?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Yeah.
When they deserve it.
We talked.
Dudley, what do you want?
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How'd you get them to retract?
What work?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Look at a picture for me.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I got her address.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
More.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
Just show me where they are!
Say what and so what.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Yes, I do, sir.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Something like that.
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
What?
Give me a minute, will ya?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
I'll take your word for it.
Why not?
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
On what evidence?
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
I like it!  I like it!
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
Down around my ankles.
Yeah.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
And no one'll know about this?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
When can you get it here?
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
What if--
I didn't use my name.
Jesus.
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
Who?
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
You're driving.
No he won't.
Goddammit--
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
Same thing?
Listen--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
I'll be right back.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Your stuff?
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Somebody took my blender.
For your wife?
You should take this seriously.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Oh, please--
Stacy--
Leave this house.
Stacy--
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
You opened the thing?
It's over.
When do I get to meet him?
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
You're not.
I <u>did</u> care how.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
We believe he did.
We'd rather not--
Fuck you. You may have to--
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
What are you talking--
Can I open 'em up?
Usually they take clothes.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
I love my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Jesus.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
You gotta--
How can I reach you?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yes. But we can't.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
I said fuck you.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
I don't care to bargain.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Her or me?
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
No, but I think I do.
Will you please come in?
This is empty, just coming!
I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
You bastard, I was believing you!
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
We've got to get you out of here.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Oh dear.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Sorry, what's your point?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
I told you so.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
Yeah, for a while.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Please don't creep around this house.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Top Hat.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
What did you say?
Off with his head!
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I can see my wife in that view.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
That's a different dress.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
I'm not sewing anything else.
No!
Is something funny?
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
No. But he hands them over.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
Of course.  When?
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
I'll always go back to that church.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
And what if he really is a spy?
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Does he have to go?
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
How awful.  What will you do?
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
I don't know, but close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Where are you at least?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
How about if you try disappearing.
I'll call an ambulance.
Are you...okay?
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Not funny.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
To our...partnership.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
There is no big job.
You don't know the half of it.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
You've thought of everything.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Surgically attached.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
But--
My god--
You gave them the eight billion.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
Suspicious, after all these years?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You're giving them to me?
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
It's those files you asked for.
How does someone get meningitis?
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
So you think we got 'em scared?
That's crazy -- why not?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
I would now.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Not in my world.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
You're not gonna be there.
Why not?
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Take it.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
That's right.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
You come to the right place.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
I don't know.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
I do.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Ten?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Better safe than sorry.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
Lock the door.
Mm-hm.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Good.
Beautiful.
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
You're part of the mining guild then?
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
They look pretty docile.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
You told me he was dead.
What's in it for me?
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
What's the little black box do?
No.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
I'm here.
Where'd they go?
Later.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Don't like it, don't come.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Who?
What the hell is this?
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
But not from your destiny.
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
You freed it, son?
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
No.
He has given up.
It is.
A lovestruck page!
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Well what's wrong?
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
I didn't know that.
Oh great, anything else?
Why don't you let me?
Of course I didn't.
What is it?
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Rats?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Yes, I go now.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A man to see you.
Yes, I think so.
Why the math?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
She used those words?
Are you sure?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
No.
Where?
You know how?
No you don't. I do it all the time.
You think?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Hi Father.
What's playing.
I've seen it.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
Intensely.
Quod nomen mihi est?
No momma.
The Lord be with you.
Amen
O'Lord hear my preyer.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Really?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
No I probably wouldn't.
Is there someone inside you?
Give me the keys!
Mondays.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
They're falling out.
How we doing?
That's not the point.
Frank.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
I don't gotta go.
What do you mean?
We don't get a gig.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No?
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
I didn't get her number.
She'll get here.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Yeah.  Something.
Yeah, fine.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
No, you take the right.
Good idea.
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
No. Why?
She's a big girl.
What?
April.
A useless talent.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Be reasonable, Jack.
Just until we find another girl.
Twenty-eight years.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
You weren't there.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Five years ago.  November.
All right.
I'm sorry?
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
I sing now?
Uh ... we'll let you know.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
Where's my name?
Time for what?
Nine!
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Yes, well, they are.
I'll call you.
Funny job.
Will I see you again?
Come on, Ed.
Yeah.
For a while.  She left.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Friend.
Must've been a cheap date.
He called her.
Oh.
Frank wasn't 'there.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Huh?
Vegetables.
I've given it up.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
The recent past.
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
None?
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
You mean if I get sick?
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
Let me have a look.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
Something good?
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
How come?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
That's what they always say.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Don't count on it.
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
When did you start smoking?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Normally, I would.  But today ...
Just following your example.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
No.
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
Call me spontaneous.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Great.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You’re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
Seven.  Really.
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
That’s where you work.
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
So could you write down her exact address?
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
No.
Me?
Please.  Just tell me what’s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Okay, you’re right, we’ve been dancing around this for years...
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
You want me to handle him?  I think I’m ready...
Okay, chief.
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Uh-huh...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Because that’s where I live.
You’re kidding me...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
What’s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
You can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
Worse, you mean...
It’s wonderful...
Way out...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Paris?
To Paris. Paris, France.
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Aspen.
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Kate? No, there’s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
No...I’m not...
Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Baby, you're scaring me.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
So are you!
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Showtime.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
What?  What do you mean you --
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
And if it should take more time to get through --
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
You can't --it's too dangerous --
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
What's that?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
That line was tampered with...
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
I'll do what I can.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
Is this a fucking joke here?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yeah, you already said that.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
GOT IT?
Yah, but that TruCoat -
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
I unnerstand.
Ya got that right.
Ya got that right.
Uh-huh... A what?
Yah.
Chaska.
You're not a C student.
Hold on.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
No, I -
Yah, I see.
but do you know that for sure without -
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, real good, then.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Twice.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
...Huh?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
No, see -
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Uh-huh.
Yah - how are you doon?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No, I didn't...
Yep.
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Yah?
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy.
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
It's terrific!
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
He's at Norstar.
He's at -
Well -
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Really, what's that?
Yeah, both of us.
Yes?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
What?
I don't know -- am I?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
Worth every penny.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
No... no problem.
Chloe's dead.
When?
What do you get out of it?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
What?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
My suitcase was vibrating?
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
What do you want me to do?
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
...no ...no ...
What list?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
This is crazy.
Is it?
He was obviously able to handle it.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I don't think that's true.
What?
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
I don't know!  Tell me!
You have jobs.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
You need me.
You will.  You know you will.
Very good, Sir.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Robert Paulson?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
You're welcome to join our club.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
I have to save Eugene!
He probably already knows we're coming.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
She had the baby?
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
May we come in?
She did.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
Clean up?  I don't...
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Sure.
I know, Dad.
He's not a witch.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Then, let's go see him!
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
That's him, but... he's not here.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
No! No! Don't!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Read you.
Home on my strobe.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
There's a compass in the handle.
You never been in one of those things.
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Nguyen is good boy.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
It's not necessary.
Have fun.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
That's it.  My life.
Those men are all dead.
Yeah.  Big time.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I say we tape him to a chair.
But now it's free, right?
Yeah.
Well did you or didn't you?
I never really...went through a... dating period.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Really?
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
No, I'm fine... really...
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
No...  He is supposed to live there?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Yeah?  Who is this?
Huh-huh.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Free?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry!
Can I take you to lunch?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
You're out numbered son.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Don't say that.
No, I...
Out where?
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
What the hell is that?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Is what you?
No, let's go...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
Sometimes.
There's nothing to say, Tita...
Yeah, well, he's...
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Just give me a chance, will you?
Thanks, Carl...
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Well, I should hope not...
Jesus, what a rude person...
Don't call me "honey," mack.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Yes.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
I'm wit' Carlos.
Wussup.
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
Of course.
So what's her name?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
C'mon.
Wha'?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
How do I know you're not lying.
Not really.
Nah.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not a prayer.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Mrs. Smith.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
Whoops.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Of course they are.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Who?
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
In this drawer....
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Sure, all drifters do.
Deal.
No problem, boss.
You doing a story on this guy?
How long have they been married?
Please.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Here, take mine.
Good point.
What is this?
Long story.
Why did you do it?
But I've seen the deed.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You shouldn't be here.
I want to hear this.
I would, actually.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
No wonder.
I'm her cousin.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Uh, almost.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who?
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Jim Swarthout?
Who's Frieda?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
So you...
Thanks, I needed that.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Ye-ah.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Who cares?  I got a case.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Let me go out like a man.
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Julian, you're fired.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
Cause if I do.
Who brings it?
This side.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
No... yeah...
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Comment va-t-elle?
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
He is not wrong.
Who financed it?
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Willie Mays.
Yeah!
When ya go back on?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Whip it out.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
Let yourself in.
Four.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
You remember Mary Finelli?
So what?
Nothing.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
I'm alright, Gibby.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What if it's not...
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
But you're not...you're not still here.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Yeah, it's me.
Tell me.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
I don't know...  What about the other women?
Whatta we do now?
I'm right here, Dad.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
John, he's got my driver's license.
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Okay, okay...
Hang on.
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Yeah.  Sure.
So how are things at the hospital?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
You have the right to speak to an att --
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where are you going?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
Where's Shelly?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
It's Friday the 13th.
Don't do that to me!
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Damn you, Shelly!
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
Whaddya mean?
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
I could swear I heard...
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Are they grown-ups?
Huh?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
You gotta be kidding!
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
Yes, but they released me because...
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
The what?
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Goddamnit!
That's very colorful, chief.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Ask me in about five minutes.
Not another word, do you hear me??
Don't be ridiculous!
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
I'm staying.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
It's not that simple.
After your parents passed away?
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I'm not!!
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
What do I exude?
Tonight. What's tonight?
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
Here we go.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
About what?
In and out of bed.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
She is kicking you out.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
Who the hell cares?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
What am I doing?
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
It's a simple subject.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
I was educated by nuns.
I think I remember.
Oh. You know him.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Everyone takes his turn.
Eleven.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
He said he's in charge...
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
Hm.  Is it?
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
So did I.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
Something's not right.
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
The Mission Director.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
What <i>is</i> that one?
A day or so.
You know I'm scared of heights.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
They found my eyelash.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Will you be okay?
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
Antonio, the choir...
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
I was at home.
Yes.
Why would we do that?
You celebrate, Jerome?
Those checks take forever.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Stay clean.
Where do you want to go?
You got the parole, didn't you?
I see it...
Do it my way.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No scars.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
No more about Beynon.
Whatever happens it's over.
I don't see how.
Pull over.
I guess we are.
What about the vault?
Aren't we going a little hard?
Sure am.
Go with God.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
I know. I know.
Yes. I told him.
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them — I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Christ, what...
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
What about?
Sid Fletcher.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Nasty.
We're there now.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
I don't know.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
At me friend's house.
Thanks.
Nobody seems to know.
Where you off to?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I see.
Definitely.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Is he staying the night?
I'm sorry.
Ta-ra.
No.
Jack Carter.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
We've got to take you back to London.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
...Polacks...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
It's too...
It's too...
You're on this...
That's right?
...that's right...
Yes.
Who?
Himself?
Starting up.
What?
No.
You...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
They have...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
How do you know he'd buy them?
I'm sorry?
You.
Yes.
What if you don't get caught?
Why would I do it?
Are you sure?
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
That's right.
In the abstract...
Because you listened.
What do you care...?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
...what am I going to do all month...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
No.
Why don't you think so?
Was I?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
No, who?
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Excuse me...
Levene!
...I only...
All that I'm saying...
Either way.  You're out.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
What does that fucking mean?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
What are you trying to tell me?
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
John: John:...my daughter...
From the store.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Lingk.  James Lingk.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
Three days.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
What position did you occupy?
 What?  You read it in the papers?
She couldn't decide.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 You're a good fellow.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Connie's outside.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
Mike, at three and a half...
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Mike wants it.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Thanks...friend.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
I'm going to the market.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Where can we talk?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
But times are different...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Very impressive.
I do not.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
Some water.
And?
Are we going to eat or what?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Fuck you.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
I wasn't going to try anything.
I didn't mean to...
You do that.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
What was wrong?
Broke is more like it.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Not at the moment.
What happened?
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
Do you miss it?
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
How long were you...?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
I was an officer.
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
Clayton is fine.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
What won't do?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's too tight.
You're crazy.
All right.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Then who did?
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
What's our pesky friend up to now?
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
Luminal.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
Good night.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
I don't mind.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Tell me about Kip -
A boost. A big boost ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Jesus ...
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Yes ... Kip ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
You know my back.
I don't think so, Detective ...
Not my girl anymore
I'll catch you later, Randall --
You betcha --
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Yeah.
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
You know where the others are?
Dignity...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
You, too, Ma...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
I dunno ...
You, too
Something like that -
Yeah --
Okay --
Thank-you ...
What?
What for -- ?
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
Okay.
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
I take out my slim-jim...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Of course you are. You're a professional...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
How is he -- ?
Hello, Otto ...
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
What happened to Sway?
She soars -
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not --
Why don't you leave him alone?
Shit all looks the same here --
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Nods.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
I'm in construction.
The bag with the envelopes.
Shit.
Jezuz Christ!
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
With what?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Jimmy.
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy  ...
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
What kind of person doesn't call?
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
Please?
All right, then.
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
She went to Medical school in California.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Okay.
You caught that, huh?
How much money you got?
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
Retainer...
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
No students work for me.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
I'm sorry.
That's right.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I don't know what it's called.
Hey, how you doin'?
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Can we do it at my office?
Jobs doing what?
Well, you're the only one.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
Me too.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
What?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Nautilus?
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
How'd it go?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
What did I think?
Do you have a soul-mate?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
I'll keep in touch.
Here's my number.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
No.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
What?
And you're sure about that?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Naw. They paroled me.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Women?
Deputy sheriffs.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
An' you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
*You* find out, I can't.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Crate fell on me.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
You're right!
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Casy! What you doin' here?
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in. 
Women is always tar'd.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Naw--not much!
I didn't mean nothing.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
I'll walk back.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
I'd a found you, Ma.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
No.
Was Granma bad?
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
You promised, Tommy.
They know he got hit in the face.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
But who done it?
Are you crazy?
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
You do not see either!--not yet!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Please don't.
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
Oh... really?
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Bad television.
What's that?
Jesus Christ!
That's probably a good idea.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Wait a minute--
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
They blame you for the compromise.
Never enough.
Will do.
That's up to Pilgrim.
Does Chicago count?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Oh yes. I forgot.
I don't care! We'd be together.
It's still early. What's your next class?
What about him?
Yeah?
What?
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Fine.
I didn't know I had to.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Don't they believe in signs here?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
No. I just thought... forget it.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
My period.
What?... Oh baby...
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
How's everything?
All right. Speak to you then.
Yeah.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
About what?
You're allergic to hay.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
No. I am a "tubab."
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Where to?
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
What choice!!?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
No reason you should, no reason you should.
What was it like?
They fired you?
You don't seem to upset?
Oh, how sweet.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Promise.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
What?
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Yeah.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
OK, OK.
Maybe... look -- just...
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
What do you mean?
Now that's cool.
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Waste the dude.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Dead?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
Blow me.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
I have to tell you something.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
You would have looked better.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Joey, Joey...
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
What number please?
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
When did you find this out?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
We're trapped in this house.
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
How do you know their not?
Because the lights are all out.
Four plus Myers.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
No.
I've got you come on, go down.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
You look sharp. You understand?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Sure.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Why did you hang up on me?
I've already lost it.
That's probably all he can do.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
Here, Lester.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure. Sure.
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Right.
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
PROBABLY going.
I'm wasting time.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Move it!
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
Well, let's hope so.
You want to see some?
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
And maybe my lawyer.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I'm an architect.
What time do you get off?
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Well, sure.
Bye.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
I almost didn't.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
I know!  I know!
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Are you in love with someone else?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
It's on the table, Dad.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Mm-hm.
They're in the basement.
Oh, Frederick!
What are you going to use for money?!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Jesus...Jesus!
No--
Like-- 
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
No.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I know, I know, and your hamster.
You look so beautiful.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Really?
Oh, now-- 
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Yeah.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
I want to experience childbirth.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, yeah. 
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
Really?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Look, everything's going your way.
So what's new?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I'm fine.
It was a terrible evening.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Are you, are you out of work or something?
You're kidding me.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Hi.
When'd you get here?
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
...how are things at the Hospital?
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
...you...
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
Then I'm doing fine.
...these guy'll back you up.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Somewhere in Italy.
I've never heard that he...
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Try Barney Clark.
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I am all attention.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
Well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Why?
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
...what did you want? 
And why should we believe you?
The shape of a Three.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
Yes.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
No.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
I hope so...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Yeah. And?
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I just never thought of you in that...
Probably.

Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Very very. The photographs?
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Is she dead?
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Yeah, I just got back.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
S'okay....
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Yeah. Scary stuff.
You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
What?
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Answer him dick!
Pretty weird.
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
Get a job.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
frowns at Henry.
What now?
Bye.
Come on, sit up.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
What does old Stew want?
Who cares!
stands and walks toward the door.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Somebody's got to help us!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
John has fallen in love with me!
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
I did more then that.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
I understand... I won't-
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Thanks.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Music to my ears.
Wow you are out of it.  
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
Right.
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Turn that thing off.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Unprofessional.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
What about a reward for coming forward?
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
I'm looking for some perfume.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Right.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
You must value your independence.
About us.
Have you just plain asked him?
Whew.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
What?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
That's not the case.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
What for, dickweed?
Put it out, man!
What did the thermometer say?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Not now.  I'm busy.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Is that it?
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Aye.
That's all?
As friends -- always as friends.
She's the King's cousin.
How?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Your life.
I lied.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
Why?  What's going on?
I'll be fine.
Not unless they're immortal.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
I think he's dead!
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
I guess so.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
I understand.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Fuckin' A.
I don't know.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
I'm not gonna leave you!
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Go, Chief.
Go.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Go, Mickey.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
Special Agent Jones.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
How about you and your sister?
Okay.
He has lots of disks.
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
Who is it?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
These disks . . . where are they?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Leave it to me.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
I don't have that much.
They're only taking the whites.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
I'll be over.
What do you mean, General?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I am on a list! What list?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Thank God.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
The commander is not here.
I need a great favor.
I will see what I can do.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
You could have asked for a favor.
They do not have your connections.
Murdered! By whom?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Give him time.
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
Yes.
What?
Why?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
As the trucks go.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Up here --
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Why not?
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Better living through electricity.
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
Then who are they?
You know everything you do gets me hot.
I know.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
Where is she?
-- and who's next on your list?
I can't remember at the moment.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
I'll take my chances.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Then who did??
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Why not?
Believe me, we need to.
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Something....happened --
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
A few years older, perhaps.
Sure.
Maybe it was Colleen...
Yes.
We're going to go someplace new.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Don't be afraid!
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
I don't know what I'm saying.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Oh, that's nice...
Did you know her very well?
So what should we do, father?
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Yes, they are.
Not at all, if it can help.
There's something through that wall!
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
And what did you discover?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Oh yeah ...
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Did you know him?
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Would you know this store again?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
Not quite.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
What do you want?
Really?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
"You could be swinging on a star."
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Oh.  No.
Wha--
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Actually he never told us what it was.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Alchemy.
If you think you're getting past me...
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Why George, you big softie...
The Jerky Circle!
The Hudswinger!
He didn't look unhappy!
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I'm happy enough.
Mind if I join you?
Why yes, do you know it?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
You know, on farm route 17.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Huh?!
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
I got big ideas, though!
Forty-eight years...
What the heck they doin'?
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
An example must be made!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
Well, I made the dean's list.
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
He notices.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
He don't look wise.
Where?
That's nonsense, Alma.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Where were you trained?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Why?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
Gotcha.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
What?
Yeah, that one.
You think I --
If you're going to insult me --
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
I'm not.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Ben.
We'll talk in the morning.
Fine.
Hnnn.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Jesus all right enough!
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
C'mon.
-- 73
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Darn it, Dave.
Let me.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Yeah. You?
Mikey Williams?
It's not a bother.
I used to know how to cook.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
That I will indeed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
I gotta get to English class.
Moisture! Moisture!
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
Geometry?
Sure.  Twinkie?
There's a TV in the basement.
You get in trouble?
Mikey was looking for you.
All my model planes.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Yeah.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Too bad...
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
Twelve years younger.
What I saw?
Anything.  It's important.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
That's right.
That's right.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
He's asking everybody questions.
Habit.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
She didn't tell me.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
My arm!
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
Oh?
Thought you might find that.
But you wanted to.
But we work so well together...
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
Ah! You have questions?
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
No.
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
You both did it?
The swamp...
Still my beautiful child.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Yes...
You want death? Is it death you want?
Why should I be?
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
I don't know any hell -
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
What are you saying?
Lestat, what do you mean?
That's all past, Lestat.
I tried...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
I'm a vampire.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
Is that bad?
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
The guy looks dead.
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
No means yes.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Then, we fight --
Come on, you can make it.
...Nancy?
Ray, we're just friend.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
This weekend?
Fine. Show me the body.
I don't know.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
It's...him.
He's in it with Willis?
Why?
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
How's Julie?
No. Yes?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
Drunk again?
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I think not.
I was looking for you.
You have forgotten my last name?
Miss Wollsten!
What if he is?
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell ——
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
Oh, now —— now look here ——
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
When you make sense I'll listen.
Well, tell, him.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
It isn't me!
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Where's Mary?
Oh, wonderful!
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Yes, sir.
Mother . . .
When'd you see him last?
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
I know –– I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Aw, forget it.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Say, where's Mother?
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Vi.
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
Some other time, George.
That way, huh?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
I'd like to do that.
All right, sir.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Five hundred dollars.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Neither am I.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
That does it –– come here.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Where's your coat and hat?
Going up to see Zuzu.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You going to the lighthouse?
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Stop paddling!
They're moving pretty fast.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
It's still there!
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Every day?
What else is there to do?
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Is that what it is?
What's that supposed to mean?
The what?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Do you?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Better yet.
In the den.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Terrific.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
We're alone.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
That's it?
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Shouldn't he be at home?
What's daddy doing?
Hiya yourself.
That's you.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Give me back my hat!
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
Oh, great.
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
When are we going out?  You and me?
Take me.
Len, can I see you a minute?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
You will.  I'll see to it.
Pre-opening jitters.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Are you coming...?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Here.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Sean, that's right...
Okay.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
It's a shark's tooth!
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
What do you mean, we don't?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Yes, aren't we all.
I told you, something's upset them.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Let's hope he knows that.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
And I like you.
Brian, he's coming around!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
And big for his age.
Sure.  No problem.
How you doing, Kelly?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Yeah, from Boston.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
And alone.
SEAN!
Now what?
Gotta sneeze.
Can't help it... ahh...
It's disappeared.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Don't hurry back.
Don't bother Hoagie....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
He was doing his job....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Turn it off....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Michael!
I'm not doing anything.
Good.
Mommy lets me....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
You just got here....
I'm fine....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
I like to travel....
Won't you get in trouble...?
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
It needs more time to charge.
You too, Michael....
Try the area around the wreck....
Will you leave me alone...?
Put me down, damnit....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Maybe he only likes white meat....
I don't like the song.
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
No way....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
What?
Yeah?
The van?
I hope I'm not intruding?
The <u>dogs</u>?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Maybe?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
No, you didn't.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
To throw out of the window.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
No.
No.
What color was it?
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
Yes, Sir.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Ask him.
One of the accountants.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Could you just stop moving?
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Oh come on --
And have fun at your bachelor party.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
We are?
I just got goosebumps.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Happy. He said "happy?"
Yeah, what happened there.
I don't know --
So this break... is a break-up.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Thanks.
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Oh my God.
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
Forget it.  Forget it.
It's a risk.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Hey, that's my word, okay?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Why not --
Go.  Flee.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Not a chance.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
You'll lose.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
This is how you play God.
What is it?
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
You mean it?
How low?
Here!
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
Just hold on.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
I try not to.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Goodbye, Alan.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
You should.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
This plane can not land!
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
It certainly does.
Minimal.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Not without a shot of the nest.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Okay.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What are they?
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
I have to find Kelly!
Why did you come here?
Why should they?
They're pushing us over the cliff.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Sattler.
Dilophosaurus.
It's my favorite.
Not just every six weeks.
Yeah, I know.
- - barfs them up - -
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Stick to my heels.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
He sends his apologies.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Yeah, they hate me.
Relatively.
We gotta do something.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
What kind of opinions?
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
That was great!
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
You have a map.
I really think we should go back...
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
Who's chest?
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
You're not going to be there?
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
Up there.
Yes -- we do.
Did you?
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
A man must eat --  And drink.
Will you do me a favor then?
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
You're just doing your job.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
What of it?
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
What makes you think so?
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
I photographed it extensively, father.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
I can't imagine you crying.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Do you always have to repeat?
Didn't want you.
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
Look -- could I use your phone?
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes -- all right --
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Most of them.
How would I remember?
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
And I don't think that was Tom.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
You and I -- a relationship.
You could at least look at me!
I don't think so.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
It's got to make sense some way.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
Goodbye, Pete.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
Two years ago? Sorry.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Greatest...
Yeah?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
That's okay...
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
I want my mommy...I want my mommy..
Good night.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Eight, almost nine years.
Yes...
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Ted, do you love him?
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
I don't believe you.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
I don't know.
No.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
No.
I understand.
Slow down...Slow down...
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
California?
What?
Ted, I just heard...
Where are you from?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Cow.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Can I free the prisoners?
Did you receive the letter?
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
You could buy them.
What do you think?
Is that big?
No. This war is almost over.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
Please, come in, so cold.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
No, Holiness.
We have.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Like my mother.
Oh, yes.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
A spring trap!
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Yup.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
It came from across the lake.
Then do it!!
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Good luck.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
No thanks.
Night.
What?
Really--
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
We might as well pack.
Well...
You wouldn't?
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
No.
Let's go.
So does he.
You too.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
I can look at dead things.
Seconds.  Three, four.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
What the hell?
I just let go of it.
That it's about to go wrong.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Are you on drugs?
Part of our research--
It has nothing to do with--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
He knew her...!
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
It's much better than your shoes.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
How would he test?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
No! That's incidental.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Yes, miss.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Let us go, miss.
Your "father"?
He did?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Our father? Did you see my father?
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
We were headed...
No.
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Fire!!!
Sir!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Fire!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Be my guest.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
He did.
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
You screw around like that again and--
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Roger.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Take it off and let me have a look.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
What are you going to do to him?
Let's hope it holds.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
I'm not touching you!
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
You get the guns?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Good, you can get this under control now.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
All right, furry muff.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
Is there no way they can get back to you?
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
Invitations?
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
A hundred grand.
For half a million?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What are you doing, Plank?
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
My van is half full.
That's going on optimism.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Please.
Chaos.
No, sir. Not at all.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Thank you, sir.
You're dismissed.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Nice job.
You got a cause of death?
He swore by it.  What?
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
Yeah, well--
Best part of the job.
Suppose not.
If it's too late--
Come on in.
I never met her.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Same as they done in Mexico.
You know who I am?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
You own this place?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Cliff--
Cliff--
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Mikey--
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
We been through this before--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
Yeah. I bet he would.
Have we had trouble there before?
Appreciate it, sir.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
And people make their choice--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
--Santiago.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Bledso
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
You thought any more about our murder?
I got an idea what happened.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
People didn't complain?
No. Is he sick?
He's going to wish he was dead.
Yeah?
What do you think?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Want to take a walk?
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Yeah.
He hates me.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
I'm going over to the other side.
Sure.
Another woman?
You believe that?
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Why?
My life was too weird for her.
doorway) And who's that?
That's so cool.
Why would I do that?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
What about death?
Don't.
You'll do more.than that.
Not yet.
It's him... it's him.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I don't know where you'd start.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Are you sure?
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
I think so.
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
He got up and walked.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
What about Swann's miracles?
Oh, I've got plenty.
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
Are you a believer, then?
Yes.
Was that Swann's idea?
Shit...
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
Yes...
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
Well... nobody.
How the fuck do you do that?
Is that all?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Yes?
Can you do it?
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
What?
Maybe... I... don't...
Not true.
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
No!
What do you do?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
No, how about you?
No way.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
Oh.
That's too scary.
Fuck off.
Working.
Do you ever see him?
Yeah.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Yes?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Fine. Is it going ok?
That's ok.
Bye.
Excuse me?
One moment.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Good...I'm tired.
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
Seemed...on edge.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
What did you hear?
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Well I know he's come here before.
What's his name?
Peter Kelson?
And also that...
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Peter, please...
What?!?!
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Yes, I know.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
He can see you Thursday.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Pants.
How is he?
Whatever.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You want the job or not?
Sort of.
Huh?
It's okay.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
So she's honest.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Hey.
Yeah.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
That what you think?
You sure?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
You're not stupid.
I...can't.
Quincy...
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
What the hell's going on?
You forgot to be there.
Few days ago.
What are the doctors saying?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Why do you keep asking me that?
What?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Better late than never, right?
Wrong.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Still is, so let yourself out.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Came by to check on you.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
My mother had breast cancer.
Oh, she's fine.
It's a helluva disease.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
Don't sit down.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
I'm coming!
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Yeah.
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Okey-doke.
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
Just Jim.
It's my favorite place --
So you've done it --
Why not?
I'm sorry.
ok.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
I've got troubles.
Yes I do.
Cynthia?
Can you hold it?
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
It's ok, boy.
Sorry, little man.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
No.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What?
Brad, dear?
Shall we drink to that?
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
I paid you back.
Yes.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Who are you gonna call?
No.
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Is this 509-9027?
I'm gonna start rolling --
Like I said, yeah --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Muffy -- coffee?
people die.
Right.
...this close...
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
Is Linda here?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
He's in here --?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
The door was open, I got a call --
I am calm.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I don't have to answer your questions.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
No.
You on any medication?
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
...you know...
You want her right now?
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
Slowly or quickly?
-- did she talk to you?
I'm not through asking my questions.
Maybe...I don't...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Are you on drugs right now?
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
I can't.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
You need to sober up.
I have to go.
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
818-753-0088.
Partridge?
yeah.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
hang in there, ok. I love you.
....Why does he do it...?
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I wish to discuss your brother.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
I have it all worked out.
Those can be adopted --
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
We must stop him!
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
But --
But --
Pull them back!
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
There are more important things than tits.
Forgiveness?
Catacombs.  Very holy.
No, not Louis!
He lures us to capture.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
Get out of my way.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
How did you know -- ?
Just... water.
And you never knew why?
Phillippe.  Rest now.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Silence!  I order you!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Get out of my way.
Forgive?!
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
Sire, I --
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
It's lovely.  It's just...
Yeah?
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Where are you?
Did you report it stolen?
Fine -
Well don't you think that's odd?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Yeah?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Well read this -
Seattle.
You're the mysterious type, right?
No, but I'm listening.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Jesus, man...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I knew I could count on you.
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Nahhh...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
Get me a plane...
I won't be here.
What's it narrow down to?
When are you coming back?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
Don't talk to me!!
How far away's the back-up?
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
It'll do fine.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
Uh-huh.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Who?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
I don't want to know.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you feel privileged?
Yes...
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
Where did you get it?!
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He only bit women so far, right?
What would you call him?
No.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Then why?
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
I want to see you, too.
What's the problem, Molly?
What's that?
Go on to the house...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
We don't know that.
How did it happen?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
...after a while.
I got it. Thank you.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
What disadvantage?
Yes.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Fight what?
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
Those are my terms.
That's alright.  Where...?
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
If you want...
It's me.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Andy... there is no real you.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
They're asking for it.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Where?
There!
I know.  It's her fault.
Right...
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
You don't, do you?
Hear what?
An accident?!
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Are they any agent?
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Yes.
No.
And she's never wrong.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Do it!
Shit, I'm sorry.
I just thought... you were a guy.
What is the Matrix?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
Yes.
... right as rain.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
Yeah?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
The Oracle.
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
Because I believe in something.
What the hell just happened?
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
Look fella...this is private...
Can't we come with you?
Uh...can we give you a check?
She don't look Jewish.
Yeah.
And say what?
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Mind your own business.
Good idea.
Nope...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
$20.
How much was the original loan again?
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
Bye.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
A paper on that one too?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Yeah, I think so.
This is a heisted car!
Quiet please.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
From the Korean War.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
He said he would be there with bells on.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
And that?
You mean this, sir?
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Hello, Quince.
Why yes, thank you.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
You have a way with words.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Please, Drew.
Yours.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Certainly, Bill.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
My Doctor Lady?
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
I'm lost.
That is not my intention.
Yes?
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
To bed.
Why don't you get off his case?
-- I guess you haven't.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
More than you love peanut butter?
Yes!
And you can't tell me who you are.
Don't.  That will come later.
'Love will find out the way'.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
Thank you.
No.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
A 'deal'?
Yes?
Of course.
There's one to every rule.
That's what everybody says.
Yes.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
What way would you put it?
Um -- not right now.
That's okay.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Those were my words, Bill.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
'...Yes --'
What?
I believe you did.
Watch it!
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
Yeah, I give a shit.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Drew told me.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
We've met.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Raise away.
I don't understand.
Where's he going?
Oh, yes --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
The fireworks are about to start.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
Burt.
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
When was I in here?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Do you remember me?
You told me.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
And? 
Yeah, I hated it.
Why would you do that?
Did you?
I'm not.
Can I ask you something?
Oh. But haven't we met before?
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Who?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
You like it? Let's trade.
Prove it.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Why not?
Maybe. Maybe just.
You won't remember!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Good.
Make it 35.
Deal.
You do.
When?
Havana.
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Maybe I'm only one.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
'Cause she will tell you.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
Like...?
Then you should.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Never heard of him.
They had me from the gate.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
"Salutations from the south..."
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Lotta rich women back there...
Men, they mostly faggots.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
I show you what problem --
What's that supposed to mean?
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
They gotta be.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Gonna be like money from home.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You got it.
Get lost.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
How's your hernia?
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
I know.
Yes.  I think so.
But just...
Something like that. Cigarette?
Beats working.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What did he do?
Twelve years.
How long?
Billy!  Please!
Yeah!
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
What?
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Learn what?
Work, work, work, that's all do
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Who?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Shit.
New York's finest.
Right.
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Go!! Just go!!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Manny...
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
We can do it!
That's it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
She used a baster.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Will I be able to walk?
Pretty rough so far.
Then the roads are open...
My daughter must be going nuts.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
The Sistine Chapel?
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
What?
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I'm sure you're right.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
From her point of view or mine?
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
A change of plans?
What are you talking about?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Uh-huh.
Far right.
- torque wrench.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You didn't do that badly.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Listen to what?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
Just like old times?
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
No...
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
'Terrorists?'
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
By asking me.
S.O.P..
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Sleeping's better.
Oh yeah?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
You don't think we're going to make it.
We did what we had to do.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
One hour.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Always.
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
What problem?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
I remember..
Youíre probably right.
I usually am.
And get a doctor.
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
I think I might just take that look.
Twenty minutes.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Try it again.
Itís not working.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
You're welcome.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I don't know what you mean.
And that's how much I'm saying.
What killed him?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Johnny Cammareri.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Good morning, Lucy.
You are going to marry my brother?
Yesterday.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
What?
She didn't like me.
I can't!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Kinda gaudy.
For what?
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yeah.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
This is where we're going!
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
Right.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
Will you marry me?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
Yes, on the floor.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Who is he?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Why not?
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Did he tell her?
It was a miracle.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
You gotta date?
What sins have you to confess?
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
It was a miracle!
Do you have a girlfriend?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Will you join me for dinner?
Nerves.
Yes.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
It's Cosmo's moon.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Am I right?
Well, how did you become king, then?
Oh!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
Of course.
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
What, "is"?
'Tis but a scratch.
No, it isn't.
I'll have your leg.
Come, Patsy.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
My liege,  I am honored.
Bedevere, my Liege.
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
I am an enchanter.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
I'm thirty-seven.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Shut up!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
The nose?
What is your name?
What is your quest?
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
I can understand that.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
But I don't like her.
Not you.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
... and you'll come and get him.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
No.  It's unhealthy.
I'm sorry, I must go.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Sixty.
She loved him.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
Louder, girl!
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Quite.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
By whose authority?
I beg your pardon?
Don't think I can't persuade her.
If you hunt, you kill.
Why do you think I keep her here?
You are well?
I'm glad of it.
Archie.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Aye, ma'am.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am.
The question is, do we need her?
Dear oh dear.
Of course.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What is the matter with him?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
Why don't we take this into my office.
I came from the city on the left.
It is.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
The Police, then...
I was afraid you'd say that.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
Yes I am...
Don't even say it.
I know.
Hold my keys, then.
Thought so.
They fired everyone.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Cynthia...what's going on?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Okay.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
You got it! See you later honey.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"But you won't..."
Do you know them?!
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
I had a dream about this place.
You see what I mean...
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
No...
No one has a gun to your head.
No time. Get him up.
We have to climb up that.
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
He hired you to build this place ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
I wanted to let his family know....
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Yes.
I work here, remember ?
That's a shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Hey , Hey !
Just shut the fuck up.
Why ?
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
I said NO.
So ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Checking........
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
Thank you, sir.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Good, sir.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I think I'll see hat action.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Really ? On a date ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thanks.
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
I don't even know your name.
I would do it again in a minute.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Have fun.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
You are?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Well...
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
ehh...I don't know I mean....
Then I have come to the right place.
Rose.
O.K. Thank you very much.
I won't.
You're over reacting!
Yeah, RIGHT.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
I'd never do that.
What if you don't wanna be found?
He is one of the great poets.
Does it work?
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
What do you think?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Ten bucks.
But...are you engaged or something?
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Yes, it does.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Is that a yes?
Sort of?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Oh no.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
I wrote that.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
In ages, I know, me neither.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Is it for a child?
The money?
He's okay isn't he?
In the garage.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh come on.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Why?
Yes it is.
Oh.
He won't give it to me.
Come on sweetie.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Sure.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Aarrggh.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
What are you saving for?
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Uh huh.
Okay, OW!
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Don't DO that!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Okay on the count of three.
Just, hurry.
Kindred spirits.
You like her.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
And you believe that.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Let's not get carried away.
I wish.
That was Thursday.
Needing.
Well, we're...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Exactly.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
It doesn't say th...
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
You've met her parents.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
... and you knew about this.
Grand Old Opera --
No.
What's wrong honey.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Oh, sure.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Whose?
Sure thing.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
National?
What crook?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Your brother?
Replacement party.
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
We don't mess with accessories.
Sixty-three.
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
I'm not sure. Where?
Wrong.
Oh.
What?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
What!
I mean...
Depends on what I'm studying.
What? Oh. A film.
He ain't really new.
He is to a lot of people.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
You always live there?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Is that good?
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Susanville, Soledade.
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Not good.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Tell me about the purity.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Sure.
Out front.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
You made every day like kindergarten.
Yes.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Two-thirty. Shhh...
How 'bout Mallory?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
When do you want the assembly?
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Okay.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Three.
Don't call my men assholes.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Where's he at?
Well, he worked around.
Any other family?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Okay, thanks very much.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Your folks live there?
My father's the preacher.
No.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
No thanks.
That's right.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
I didn't know you had one.
What's he like?
Well, what d'you think?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
You still didn't answer my question.
You will.
What the hell could you do?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
What d'you mean?
Yeah. That's right.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Beat it!
Okay.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
What did you say, boy?!
Whenever he's got an edge on.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Thank you.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I guess not.
'Musta knocked her up.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Right here.
Omar--
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
How's the villa's security?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Can you walk?
Maybe so...
Right...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
How are we doing?
Can you take me to it?
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
What are you talkin' about?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
What?
No!... No...
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Why should I want to meet him.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Almost two days.
What the fuck... are you serious?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Why do they listen to Guy?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Sure. No problem.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
YOU KNIT?
No Roger from op/ed?
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
You stood for like a month.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
Transitioned?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Hey--I can be out of control.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
You said that already.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Better person than I.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Little known fact.
That's the spirit!
Really?
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Yeah, actually I do.
No, I'm alone.
I just can't look at you the same way.
I finally found my story.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Lock.
We can handle it.
And heavy...
No!
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
Just out for a while.
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Ken!
He's dead, you bitch.
He'll die with me!
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Yeah.
I know.
Make a left at this corner.
What do you mean?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
Eggs?
No.  I'm okay.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Sure.
What?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Nancy...
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
That's right.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Neil, please --
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
Cooling down.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
I won't allow it.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Uh, fourteen.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Films mainly.
Fifteen million dollars.
Really?
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
No.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Nothing.
She left me.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
You've got to go.
Why?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Well done you.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Okay.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
Excuse me?
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
And this is William.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
It was good.
Ahm... Bernie.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Topol.
Not classic, no.
Do you ever masturbate?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Buggered?
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
So -- any messages?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Absolutely not.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
And you get on very well.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Oh sure.  Of course.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Tell us about it...
I-I-I...
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Who? Tell me!
Mister McMurphy!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
What for?
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
No way.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
A vote is before the group.
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am.
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
O-o-o-oh...
Shhh...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Where ya goin', Mac?
They went that way.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Right, Mack!
Now, what would I be trying to say?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
So why are you talking to him?
What for?
I'm the coach!
I don't trust you!
No!
Hear what?
That's a dime, Martini.
A nickel.
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Oh, what was that?
I don't, Doc...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
We'll let you know.
Time out!
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
You look pretty healthy to me.
You're breathin' right now.
You're on!
Oh, yeah?
How much ya wanna bet?
That right?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
I don't have any.
Thank you.
Take you han's offa me!
Evenin', ma'am.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
That!
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Seriously.
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Yes.  We did.
Oh no.  Do you?
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Thanks.
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
You didn't answer my question.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
What?
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Hi.
Yeah.
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
Nice dress.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Beautiful place...
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I don't know, Kate.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Oh.  Right.
Right.  My brother.
What's she saying?
Is he looking at us?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Yes.  He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Larry, did you rent a car?
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
What?  You know him?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mm—hmmm.
I know. I know.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
I can get home all right from here—
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
Thanks anyway.
What for?
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
That was nice of you.
I don't know.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
His— racket?
And if you don't?
But that's living like an animal—
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Told him what?
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, for God's sake.
Farm...
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Pop!
I don't want to hear it in there.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
You go to—
Are you on the level, Father?
I don't know nothing.
Yeah?
Sure... .
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Easy. Easy, boy.
Forty-five bills.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
Listen, Johnny—
Look who says bum!
If I could get my hands on you...
Where?
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Nothing is worth your life.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
A situation easily remedied.
What kind of symbol?
It would seem so, Master
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
You mean...!
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Yes, sir, Master.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
What're you talking about?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
You were his what, his box?
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
Shit.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
Or two.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
You know how I felt about her.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
I have to qualify, is that it?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
They're in 7D.
Yeah, why?
Call and tell you.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Glenn didn't tell you?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
If I could have a little more room.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
I thought so, too.
Peter Finch.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You have to be kidding.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
She did, huh.
Why not?
Outside Adele's.
To warn her about Chino.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
I don't know.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Must be a real soft pillow.
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
It's a big house.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not leaving Midge.
For a time.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Glenn, take the exit.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Gimme another hint.
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
Why would I do that?
I <i>was</i>...
Just a minute.
I'm looking for Maurice.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Then they're not separated, are they?
What'd I say?
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
Hello?
Not at all.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Ten gees.
Are they dead?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
What facts are those?
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Come on!
We've always tried to beat each other.
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
You were more like brothers.
...He said that?
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
Y-Yes Sir.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You too, 'Mam.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
Learn English, then!
Good—bye, Grandma.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Peggy Sue!
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
He does?
It's that jerk Walter.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
And nothing will ever change that.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Would you?
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Charlie, how are you?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
What?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Come back to me.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
What about Janet?
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Of course.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
It must run in the family.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Oh no!
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
How do you feel?
The house payments.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
When do we start?
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
What do you know about hypnosis?
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Well... uh... thanks...
Yes... why?
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I'm not burying him here...
There's a better place...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Sounds delightful.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Funny.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
As in, the vegetable?
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
Arline?
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Sure. It's fine.
I still am.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
No.
No.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
People who want to bend the rules...
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Fine, Joe.
That's perfectly clear.
Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
What whispers?
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
But they...they could still be....
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
It's starting....
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
What, switch what?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
That's what I said.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
I never said I was.
Never said you were a hype, either.
For your own fear.
What, you're goin' off, too?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
I'm born-again.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
No. She's not.
Just realized that, huh?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
So which one caught your eye?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
But how long is a day?
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
Let's find them all.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Sustained.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
We're here to stay.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Try telling them our names.
I think you're making a mistake.
He wouldn't leave her.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Read it yourself.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Of course.
Then you admit --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
God bless you.
But perhaps he understood --
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Says he can't walk.
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
...there's nobody.
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
You don't want to hear about it?
Right...
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.

Okay. You win.
Why certainly, baby.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
Much too late.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Just who are you, anyway?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
You don't know who he is?
No use waiting, then.
So have I.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
They'll look for you.
And Betty Mayfield--
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
There would be a moon tonight.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
You-killed-him?
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
If I did-I don't-now.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
That's an evasion and you know it.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
If I understand what you meant by that.
What does he see?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
I can't answer that.
Name it.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Sometimes.
How's life treating you?
The usual grind.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
A couple of hours.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
No idea.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Lay off, can't you?
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
A little something on account perhaps?
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
We don't need him.
Right.
Such as?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Brandon handled the money envelope.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
I do.
Why should I mind?
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I have a rough idea.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
I told you she's just..
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
He was delightful.
What a shame.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Sit on that log, dear.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Hello.
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
No.  I'd want to--
Freshman and sophomores...
Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
Why not.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Come on.  Hand over.
Ha ha...
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
No.
Oh no!
Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
Promise.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
You do it... you first!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
There's nobody else here...
Yes, sir.
The shit they pull, huh?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Got it...
Thanks, buddy.
Right here, partner.
Got it.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Kid, get outta the way!!
I need you to teach me.
I'm serious.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
You don't have to.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
You never did know when to quit.
Who's our back-up on this?
Well somebody sent them.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
It's been a long time, General.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
No.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
You what?
Yes.
The price just went up to ten.
You're joking.
Fine.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
You're forgiven.
Please.
What id we run into someone I know?
Fuck off.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
But don't they have it in English?
I've never treated you like a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
No.
I'll bring it back.
No one you know.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Why'd he want you?
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
What if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Me?
Yeah, well, I check out today.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes...
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I just might do that.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
I could kill you now.
And a good thing too.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
How many could you handle?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Open it up.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
Yes.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
As you wish...
Sire.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
No.  To the pain.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
I swear it will be done.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Are you a rotten liar.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
An hour.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
"To my honey I'll croon,
Scared.  Can't talk.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
Where?  What?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
What???
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Right.
You found a flop!
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
What???
You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
With whom?
I don't know.  I don't know.
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
We can't play today?
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
Nietzche...
The Blue Max...
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
I told them we invaded England.
I'm not the police.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Money.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Casharoonie!
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Okay. If you'll come along...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
I don't know.
With you.
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
She haven't even called you?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Who's he?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
She always tries to be proper.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Bates never denied Mary was here.
We could laze around here a while longer.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
Sam!
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
No.
Sam, let's go get married.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You'd know, of course.
You go out... with friends?
Why don't you go away?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
I'd like to, but...
Good night.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
You slept here all night?
Please.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
I don't know what you've been saying.
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Shut up! Shut up!
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
I'd like to have a look.
How? What can I do?
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
That called ... commanded ...
Yes!
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
Did you? Where?
I don't agree with you.
You would.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
That's the way I feel about it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What!
I used to be married to one.
Let it go.
No kiddin'?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
That's what I said.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
Yes.
Thanks.
You did miss --
Excuse me???
It's an experiment.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
In what sense were they bad?
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Actually, I am, though.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
The girl strikes like a cobra.
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
What'd you say, Brother?
Let me see!
What are they doing, Doll?
Is that all?
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Yeah, they're in the snow.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Yes, we know her.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Oh. Did you say something?
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Yes, of course.
Quarter of twelve.
Boys? You say to me boys?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
What did you forget?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Well, it has buttons.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
No, you're not.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
What and?  That's what I got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Lay off once, would you?
What do you want me to do about it?
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
They shot us all, kid.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Oh... okay.
General Jim Beam, then.
You can't be serious.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
You know... you could say thank you.
Absolutely.
Don't crowd him.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
That's not true.
Gimmie a minute.
How'd we do?
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
Keep 'em busy.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
But I had to help my friends.
Yoda spoke of another.
Yes, my Master.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Leia!
I don't know.
Lando!
Lower it!
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
We shall double our efforts.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Oh, no.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Then you know why I have to face him.
But, why must you confront him?
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
Yes or no will do.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Janet.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Weiss.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
I hope so my darling.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
Makes you cry
Now I
That ain't no crime
Oh no no no no.
No no no no.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...I'm sorry.
And you never got the chance?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
I'll call your brother.
No, I don't belong here.
They're all the same.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
'Bout seven.
I'll be waiting.
Is everything all right?
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
Get that doctor.
...Stop jivin'!
Where're you off to now?
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
Ya still light seventy.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Do I have to pay juice?
Gonna try.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Sparrin'?
Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
What was I gonna say?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Yeah, Kayo.
Rice is a bum.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
...The guy's great.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Creed's great.
Bullmastiff.
Hey --
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
The story -- what's happenin'?
Whatta these guys want?
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
Do you feel you have a chance?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Yeah...
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Sounds like singin'.
What the hell's a freeway?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
What am I, Earl?
No...
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
A joker to the end.
Eddie, come on.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
That was the idea.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
A Toon?  Noooo.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
From this box here...
No better?
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Art thou hurt?
He shall be endured
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Hold Daughter!
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
I take thee at thy word.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
A most courteous exposition.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
NO! Mercutio!
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
I'm up for that...
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
You lose them!
Not yet...
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
What do you mean?
In here...
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I don't have it with me...
Sent it where?
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Nobody's going to do that!
I do, I do...
Not exactly.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
As in, they own it?
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
It's my job.
It is at that.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
I don't know...
In a minute.
Because I don't walk away.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
Finish the job...
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Dwayne listen to me -
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Shit, more than that.
Well someone's gonna find them.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
I don't know...
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Then Sally comes too.
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
I'm all ears.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
What are you proposing?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
You mean that guy was an agent?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
I might have to look into that...
Nothing's wrong.
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm in here.
That son of a bitch.
And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
What did he buy?
Yeah.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Dwayne.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
So be here at three.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
I don't know...
What?
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
It certainly is...
I think I am.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Anything in it?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I said get on your feet!
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
I'm sorry.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
You said --
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Gimme the binoculars.
What?
I don't need a turn!
It's a bomb.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Dancing?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
The Plaza Hotel?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Baby Duck?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Ricky Tan?
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Shortcut?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
It's him.
What do you hear?
I am from outa town.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
The Feds?!
What's wrong with that?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
You a cop or something?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
He is very good.
I was trying to find the right time.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
"Make the shot."
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Then you'll be my best man.
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
You have one?
Twice...
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Six-fifty.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
No.  You take it.
Brian told you that?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
That's called changing your mind.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Yup!
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Would it?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Maggie, it's just a joke...
So you're angry.  Big deal.
I hate boats.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
That doesn't make any sense.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
I love that dream.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
Okay.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I want my money.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
How amazing.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
Magic.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Hello.
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is not --
Eighty dollars.
Window.
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
My feelings exactly.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
What?
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Like do you believe in heaven?
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
No.
Okay.
What about camping?
Yes?
What do you mean?
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
Absolutely.  Right.
I read the same article...
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
What?
What's more important than sanitation?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
No.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Sun up.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Will you be still?
But honey ...
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
You mean Delaware?
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
You've got to help around the house!
Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
That bad, huh?
Go ahead.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Never heard of him.
I try.
What is wrong with you?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
I'm kind of busy.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Why?
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
How?
Guess it's our turn.
Midnight?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
Can your man handle that?
Can you set that up?
Sure.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Palmdale
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Thanks for not laughing at me.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Yeah, dickhead.
You go, boy.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Yeah.
What's he holding?
To who?
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
There's no motels around here.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
...alright, let me know when.
Where are your men now?
Spit it out, Captain.
Not where I come from.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
The hell he didn't.
I guess.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Did he see any sign of them?
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
You?  Leading a squad?
I've got a line on one.
That's not what we're here for.
Since when have things been normal?
How about you take your position?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Yes, sir.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
But we accomplish the mission.
I coach the baseball team, too.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
And your former wife.
Hey, sis.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
I already did.
Come on, it's graduation.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Dad.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
I'm fine.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
I like him a lot.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
You're right.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Thank you very much.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Busy?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well, not monumentally.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
No, I'm serious.
You think so?
Come on.
Okay, bye.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Friends with potential.
Yeah.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Yeah.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
I know this part, keep reading.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Hey.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
Look -
You asked for shoe polish.
This is not my problem.
Look it up.
Yeah.
Wine?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Would it do any good?
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
That's smart.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Fair enough.
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
It's under control.
So we found a compromise.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Yeah, right.
Don't worry...
Stay away from the cop.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
It's good to see you involved.
Are you in danger now?
What?
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
..it's really about family and tradition...
Now.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
What are you talking about?
He's after me.
Don't panic.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
What kind of a game?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Good bye Ben.
Closer than you think.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
What did you know about your mother?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
The killer called her.
No.
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
Follow me.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
You used to say that was our strength.
What?
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Who is it?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
They're the ones who approved it.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Yeah.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Who's this.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Huh, fine.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
No.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Who is this?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
WHERE?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
And if you get it right -- you die.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
You sleep in THAT?
I'll only stay a sec.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Fuck you.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
It happens. Take it easy.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?
You have to have a favorite.
Guess.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What do you want?
No-bored.
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
YES!
But you're doing so well.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
What were you doing out here?
Yes, sir.
What is it? Where's Casey?
About thirty seconds.
It'll be out later this year.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Uh-huh.
No you didn't.
Working, thank you.
Don't shoot. It's me.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Like you had one.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Are you serious?
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
It's all part of the game.
No way.
Do they know who did it?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Deal.
Announcing what?
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
I heard.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
What?  What?
Okay...
Hello.
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
Just wait!
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
We'll tag along.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Call an ambulance.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
No.
We don't know for sure...
You can't go in there.
"What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended."
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
I will.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
What did you say?
Put the gun down, Somerset!
What?
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
Why don't you finish the job?
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Yes sir...
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
That's what I said.
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Keep talking.
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Whatchu doin'?...
Cut it out, will ya...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
We got two around that age...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
What are you talking about-
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
And the title of this piece?
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Right you are, governor!
You have the money?
Wait!  Will you desist!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
On my mother's side the Ardens
Yes, I saw it.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Nobody knew!
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Who wrote that?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
How goes it, Will?
And yours?
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
Be still.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Oh, not for the world!
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh--no, no!
Oh, but it is mine too!
You lie.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
But why me?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
No, sir.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
A man, my lord?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
You're a bad loser.
Can I show you something?
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
He couldn't get his car started.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
How much did you pay?
You're not eating.
We just wanted to speak to you.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
About the mail --
But there's no --
What does it look like?
I don't know them.
Yes, thanks.
Well, yes.
Cameron?
Yes.
Alex.
His car's still there.
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Yes.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Don't.
Unfeasible.
No, I don't.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
What?
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't you ever stop?
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
It's about the burglary.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Did you ever kill a man?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
No.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Right here?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What happened to that guy?
Did he sound upset?
You know about it?
And that's not the same thing?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Yes.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
Gee, that's very serious...
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care.
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
I don't know. Just a minute...
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Well she...
... what?...
Let it ring.
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
... just, you could look very heavy...
You are.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
You do know what money's like these days.
Buffums?
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You do it.
You are today.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
You would?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
I just have to do one little thing.
What?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Don't, don't, don't...
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
I don't know what gets into me.
You were great.
-- oh I thought you were --
Mmmm --
Well then what are you trying to do-
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
What with?
Otis is dead.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Okay... thanks...
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
What?
I just... who what?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
-- Sure.
Yeah.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Go where?
Going where?
Your advice!
Neither do I, baby.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
Oh, Christ.
What difference does it make?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
What did you say?
In a way. But...
I'm better than the guy I work for.
You're right.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Isn't that bad for it?
Sit down.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Have a drink.
What about her?
She's nothing but a whore.
No.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
A daytime soap opera.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Aren't you going to have one?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
Oh yeah?
We don't think marriage is important.
-- Yeah, honey...
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Honey?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Is he an enemy?
Let's do that.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
Three weeks.
Are you married?
Come here for a minute, first.
Yes.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
I won't, Mom.
Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Oh!
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Grady... oh.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Sure.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I did?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Uh...huh.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
Yes.
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Yes?
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Oh...
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Royalty?
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Huh?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Yeah... sure.
I told you!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
What you say?
Probation?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Oh my! 
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
I know.  It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Again!
I... I...
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Right.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Give me a C.  A C!
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
What did He say?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
No problem.
Until sundown.
A what?
Your cell.  Your room.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
The majority has spoken.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Don't push it.
So I don't shop.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Think again!  And get out of here.
Then-you run.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
I am?
I've been worried about you.
Even nuns have to pee.
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
That she's a nun!  That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Willy -- hit the lights.
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
But how do we get there?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
How did you hear this?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
What of it?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Protest to my superiors if you like.
May we look at them now?
A fine idea.
At times I do.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
The Western Woods.
I have others.  All I need is this.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
What does it mean?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
They have done nothing of the sort.
But, why?  Tell me why.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
I can't remember.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
What do you like to eat here?
Yeah.
Okay. You don't have to though.
It's too big.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
Would y'all like that?
No sir.
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
I get nervous, that's all I know.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
How come?
Did you want to play ball with us?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Maybe they needed it.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I like the way you talk.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
Why?
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
No sir.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
I'm glad of it, honey.
Did Vaughan go home?
Did Karl go to bed?
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
Me, too.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
I want to come back and stay here.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Yes ma'am.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
We sure like havin' you.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
I've heard it said that way.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
Okay.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
I know.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
I'm sorry.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Why won't he talk to women?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Will he be supervised?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Better make it charge. 
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I'd love to.
Forty-one pages.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Uh, better make it one.
You usually get two.
You got it.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
You don't give up, do you?
For keeps?
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
It'll never be finished.
Thanks for the tip.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
What can I do for you?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
What's your offer?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
What are you talking about?
Yeah? And why is that?
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I owe you something.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Is your father an artist?
He's dead?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
And?
Why don't you go to the police?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I'm not going to do it.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Medium rare, please.
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Why?  We're only talking.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Tht was summation, Your H...
Oh, yes.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Have a look.  At nothing.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Still lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
I'll take two.  One for later.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
For the third time, yes.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Not in those words.
Get lost, will you?
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
Hey, she's ticklish!
No we're not.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Right.  We have the same blood type...
- Type O.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
You tore it again!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I got pinched in the elevator.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Me?  After Sugar?
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
You can both go take a flying jump.
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
I may throw up.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Terribly sorry.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Anything wrong?
I'm a very sick girl.
How's the bottle?
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
I met one of them.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Bull fiddle.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Most of the time I slap it.
Wanna bet?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Goodbye?
Sorry.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Yes, Joe.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Afford it?
I'll say.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
- Inauguration balls -
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Why?
Oh?
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Um, just about everyone.
Fair enough, but I’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
Oh, hello.
Hello, Katmandu.
Brilliant.
I slept with your sister.
Love.
What is?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
What do you think?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Desperation?
Hi.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
You have more than one gynecologist?
I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
I’m so sorry.
You pawned it.
It’s complicated, Dad.
“...but it’s getting there. “
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
Let me see it...
Sometime, but not like this.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
NO! N-O, NO!
Yes, sir...
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
When's that?
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Yes mam...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Well, let me have it.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Little chilly.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
But, Nathan--
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
AGAGAH!!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Eric?
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Hey, Chef.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
MPH RM!!!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Aw, ma!!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
Guess.
FREEZE!!
We can't leave without you!
I don't know, dude.
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Yeah, they suck.
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Hey, come here, guy.
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Check.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh yeah...
Well I appreciate that.
So...
I'm sure I will.
I did nothing to the monitors.
They are awaiting further information.
The device has stopped responding.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
That's right.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
I don't know.
Just considering our options... sir.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
No...
I can't!
I'm about to blow the wall.
Sooner than later.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
A bowler.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
The pin machine?
You have orange whips?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Lemme see your ball.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Are you guys bruddas?
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Putt-putt golf?
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Clam it!
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
I found dad.
Buzz Fazeli.
You shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
I don't want to play.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
What if he wants to get out?
Why would you help me?
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
He's my father, Millie.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
What's plan B?
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Why should I help that old fuck.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Why not?
He's dead Sheila.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
What about plan C?
I am a professional man.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Storm?  What storm?
A thousand feet.
What?
-- Wait a second --
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
I think I do.
She should've known better.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
Internal power.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What are they?
Eggs.
So what?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Don't do this.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I would.  But my suit --
But I don't know how --
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Valdomet.
Sintag.
No, he can't.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's either this... or I kill you.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Don't you know?
Leave me alone, Norman.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
What?
Get away --
For whoever's in that thing.
I never said that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
What?
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
So what?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
How do we decode it?
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Gimme a second --
Her legs are in the way.
No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
This way, sir.
Really?
You've heard of me?
What report?
Please, Ted.
The creature?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
They never used to send a Navy car.
Who's going to pay me then?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
I'm not going out there.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
May the Force be with you.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
You mean I generate an energy field?
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
How can you store an energy field within you?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
They use the Bogan Force.
He's bluffing...
Yes, sir.
You don't believe in the Force?
Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Yes, sir !
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
You got it bad.
Ace of spades.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
I do.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
He's nothing like you.
I'll go for that.
Alright, I love you.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Yes, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Sure.
No thanks, Diz.
What's that, Diz ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I wouldn't mind.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Good for you. Go find out.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Yes, sir !
They have repressed the Creator.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
I'm aware of that, sir.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
No.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Sit down, please.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Any reply from them?
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's about life.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
Goodbye.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
...I always thought so...
Mmm.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
What?
I don't drink.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
It used to be the Old Mill.
What've you got?
I told them what you said about the script...
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
...what...?
Yes...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
If I go to jail...?
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Yes, that's right.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I'm having dinner with W...
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Joe, the writer?
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
If there's anything I...
We know that you weren't.
Who is her agent...?
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
I like you, too.
But we...
I...
Yes, yes, but...
I can't do it, Walt.
Is...Is the Movie!
I know, I know.
I...
The minute I read that script I said...
...yes...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
You were in the car with Bob?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He didn't have to tell...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?
It burnt down.
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I...
I can only write on a manual.
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
No, what is it?
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
I...
How do you know you saw it?
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
That's what I said.
Find the money.
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
I want them thrown in jail.
So we just got lucky.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
I don't care.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
...why do you think?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
Like how?
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
You have to ignore him.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Yes.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
This is my daddy's house --
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
But Rache...
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
No!  I have to get there.
Rache can do that part.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
Yet another spaghetti night.
We're going to win this.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Fine, forget it.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Yes?
Don't flatter yourself.
But I came here to...
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
I don't, but...
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
That's not wh...
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
So I'll have to order in?
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
I'm gonna get me a drink.
What if he is?
What?
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Thank you.
Yes.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
My Jesus…
Why was he on Death Row?
No, you don't.
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
What?
What's tomorrow?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Maybe he's that one in a million!
OK!
Come here, give me a hug!
Well, now you have.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
No.
Thanks.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Great!
That's good. So then what do you do now?
How many?
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
Is it loaded?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
So where'd you get in?
But what did you get on your SATs?
He did?
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
What's that supposed to mean?
What happened?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
I'll let the senator tell you.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Excellent.
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
There's enough in one vial...
I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
So what?
That's government property, Major.
What is your name, young lady?
What did you say, sir?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
No, sir.
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
You aren't sure!
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
This is General Ripper speaking.
That's right, sir.
You're right, sir.
Yes, sir.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I know that, sir.
Ask away, Major.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Do you think we'd cheat?
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
War.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Look, can't someone help me?
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Primary trigger switch.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
What happened?
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Recall what mistake?
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
You tell me.
Look, this is different.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Let me check.
Roger.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
What did you guys think?
Typical male.
You didn't get me in trouble.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
It's really not about anything.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
The dude wants it.
No, no.
Okay.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
No, no.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No. Life is too short.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
You know?
Erica is in the van back there.
Yeah, man.
Come on.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Great.
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
You better! Yes!
This is private property, my friend.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Oh, you were there?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Yes!
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
He is.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
What'd he get you?
Military marching bands.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Let's see.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Mm-mm.
Two-fifty? They go up?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Is that Bee-Bee?
Seven-twenty.
I don't know.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Okay, what would you have done.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Sooze.
What feelings?
Come with me.
Nothing.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, I don't.
What?
For a ride.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, fuck it, man!
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
Just go.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Well, what about this?
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Oh, yeah?
Like?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
You done?
Yeah?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Yeah?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
No car.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Look, it's really not my fault.
Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
Conan went to Harvard.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Spit from your dad?
Jack...
Mmm-hmmm...
We were told you could "fix us up."
Hello?
Kim-Lo?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
All of you!
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
I hear she was a terror to work with.
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
Action! The scene starts.
Hi, Artie.
It's from hunger.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Why, you sweet kid.
I had a teacher like that once.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Well....
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Phillip, you're mad!
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I was afraid of that.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
So do I.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
What happened?
Whose house is it?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Why did she call me?
If you love me, Joe.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Nobody asked you to.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Why?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I will not have it butchered.
What month?
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
What's wrong with It?
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
I don't need a tuxedo.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
The other guests?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Cut out that us business.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I think I'll read a little.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Is that so!
I'm not here.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
Whatever you say.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you mean we?
What do you want?
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Well, just one.
What an adorable hat.
And you think you're in love.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
I don't want your help.
I could force you.
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
Yeah.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Nice to meet you.
Theories?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
You're not...an orphan are you?
It doesn't seem right.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Then come with me.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
What? What did you tell me?
Clark.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Mom and I do this all the time.
What!
Yeah.
What kind?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Who gets it, the company?
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Or socks.
Black or regular?
That what they call you?
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
We've already met.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Tell me.
Storms! Floods!
TOMORROW THE OIL!
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
What's wrong?
Where did it come from?
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
A normal person.
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Really?
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Let's go to my place.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Oh, hi.
You're not selfish at all.
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
It's beautiful.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
 DELETE IN CUTTING
North.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Zod.  Zod.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Who?
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Nobody else.
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
A hot story, huh?
I know.
North. It's north
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Not really, no.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Screaming
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
I'd better get you down.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
He is. Usually.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Of time, Luthor.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
We're...not together.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Yeah.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
A while.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Good night.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
And they loved Bear.
Did his parents attend to that?
I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
You hate it.
Isn't it a lovely day?
What happened to summer?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
That's what he said.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Yes.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Indian?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
You've been retained?
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Yes.
Really?
Of course.
The ramp?
Do you like the colour?
How will he do that?
No.
Great.
There's talk of that.
But of course...
I only had a few hours.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Who said Sidney?
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
Can I come in for a minute?
I have a message from your sister.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
How?
Talk to her yourself...
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
And where was his wife?
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
But what?
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
Like you?
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I didn't do anything!
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
What chip?
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Right.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why him?
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Can you get us in there, past security?
Yes.
Relax now, Sarah --
On all what?
Respect your elders and your betters!
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
I'm very sorry.
So what is it?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Five minutes.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
Go ahead, be my guest.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Tell me about von der Null.
Yes, von der Null.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Yes, that's what happened.
What?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Of course I know what that is.
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Nope.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
You're late.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Alright, the beige one.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
I don't understand...
The what?
Come here.
About what?
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Molecular-memory.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
Not possible.
No.  Never.
You're not supposed to.
Why?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I can't sleep.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Shut up.
What?
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Oh, no... you.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
You're the one who started running.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Right.  Call me Christy.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Where'd you get this?
Well... the red bra.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
I'm back from the dead.
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
No!
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Which grad-school?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Yeah.
You shouldn't have.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Are you still on mediction?
Do it for YOU.
Who?
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
Stop this.  It's not true...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
No, thank you.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
It was a different floor then...
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Goodnight then.
What's this about?
The Hinchberger wedding.
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
It was a misunderstanding.
Who's Watts?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
I've read your tests.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
Yeah.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
Well... we're glad to have you.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
It was very specific.
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
How'd I know it was for you?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Nell, what do we do?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
So far.
No one will come any nearer than that.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
No.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
Yes.  I've missed it.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
No, it's getting worse.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
As soon as you get dressed.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Italian.
I'm a gracious host.
Why not?
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
Lookin' good.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Huh?
Has he?
What post office?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
You just cooking then?
Hell, no.  I started writing.
It's been a while.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Modelling.
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Why not.
Are you serious.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Of the deal, man.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Hey.
The L.A.P.D.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
I don't get it.
How we gonna get that lucky?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Since when?
Susan.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Go now.
Tell me.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Hello, Tony.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
Geez, Mr Crane.
But more or less.
Ah.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
That right.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
Sure.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Yeah.
That'll be fine.
Look, uh... Creighton...
What kind of man *are* you?
Just coffee.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
How's that?
Honey...
You don't have to--
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
How did you get into the store?
...I don't think so.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
...Nah.
Uh-huh.
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
He's the dead guy.
Yeah--
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
I'm in.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
What doors?
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
I believed them.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
What's that doing here?
I don't believe it.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
You're right.
What are they?
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
He's right.  Follow me.
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
But at what a price.
How did you know that?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
Then it won't go after the others?
How?
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
<i>A month.</i>
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Trust me.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
What's that?
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
What do I do?
You hate gambling.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I think I'd like a little company.
There's been an accident, Truman.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
It looks so small.
Things always do--when you look back.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
You got it.
Well, thank you for your help.
Who?
Penetration but not perforation.
They took her --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Working with?
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Into what?
Kurtzweil, we think.
I'm looking for him.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
No. Don't bother.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
He just let it explode.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What killed those men?
What?
That would be my guess.
I'm on the roof.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
Why not? It's three AM.
Evidence of a massive infection.
Mulder --
And you've never seen anything like that?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
This virus -- it... 
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
Just like that --
I think... something stung me.
Where are we?
I don't have his number.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
About the conspiracy?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Driver.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
I do it all the time!
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
No.  No.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
What then?
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
If you believe that.
Tell me.
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Already there.
What's wrong?
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Tell you what?
Where is she?
Anna.
What are you going to do?
Why?
Have you seen Calloway?
Have you?
How did you know I would be here?
I shall be all right.
His.
Keep the packet.
And my passport?
That's what we want to find out.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Just around the corner.
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
You a friend of Lime's?
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Bring him in.
Thank you. Excuse me.
She's right. It's none of my business.
Win what?
Do you know his number?
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
No, a major, were you really?
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
What about?
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Never heard of him.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Zwei zwartze.
A Roumanian.
How do you do.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
I have guests waiting.
Not necessarily.
I was told that he did not die at once.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Something wrong.
Never.
Richard. Hi.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Thanks.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
We moved rooms because of him.
A bit fucking late.
Two.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
We swim.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
What's he care about?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
V'asitem...
You shouldn't.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
I'm stealing it.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
They're liars and cowards.
A poison...?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Get the fuck away from me.
To hear them read Torah.
I don't do that.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Number ten.
The mother.
It will.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
I have an idea....
What are you trying to say?
What do you think you should have done?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Obviously.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
So what?
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Does he know?
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Don't you agree, Jacques?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
And where did you say you were from?
I didn't say...  Brussels!
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
I dove 315 feet!
I don't have one.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
... You married?
Get in the car!
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
I don't want to erase anything.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Who?
... Especially the sneakers.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
I'm still here.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Anything.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
They got the new T.V.
What?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
He isn't going to breathe.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
What's your first move?
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
You get your money from your husband.
I sleep it off.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
You really think so, Charlie?
Up at the museum.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
I want to ask you something.
Yes?
About Charlie's leopard?
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
That was a calamity!
Thanks.
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Yeah.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Yes. Do you mind?
I got into a little crap game.
What! You can't be --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
How do you know?
You a tourist?
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Anything is possible.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Something like that.
You wouldn’t understand.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
I know where to look.
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
A criminal?
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn’t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
What sort have you got?
What company?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
What if it is?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
When... I’m told he came here...
Clients come and go.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
Is she on the phone?
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Viens.
Où est passé ton salon?
I don’t have your credentials, Nathalie.
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
Why did you kill him?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
Majesty, I can't...
So... pretend it's not a game.
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
So... what am I supposed to do now?
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
But it is what I want.
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
To avoid killing anyone.
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
God defeated the English, not me.
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Many things...
Silence her!  Take her away...!
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Supposing she's an assassin?
That's not a lot.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
He's on the other side of the river.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Me too...
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
That's now what I meant...
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
So your memory's coming back?
I agree...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What for?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
Yes, my lord.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Him?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
He'll be here soon.
Yes, please.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
I can look after myself!
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
You made contact?
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
... without a shred of manners.
That is good, yes.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
I'll be back.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
No.
Spoken words?
He chopped it off
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
It's my mother's piano.
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Forget it.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
Who's got the contract?
Hackers.
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
You mean you blew it.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
He threatened to kill me.
No.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
Lonnegan.
See and raise five.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
Who are you?
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
No.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
Why don't ya then.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
Let me talk to him.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
I'll make parole.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
You weren't hired to miss him.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Why not?
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not?
Oh, Andy, Andy!
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
He's a brave man.
Only in bad weather.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
That woman!
What's he want of you?
What do you mean?
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
--was Wynant's.
About three.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
Let him have his say out.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
That's my business.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Never mind.
Is Julia going with you?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Well, don't you?
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
All right - you didn't.
Why tell me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
This is your party.
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
How many drinks have you had?
That last Martini.
Can't you get to sleep?
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
There's one coming.
Want a drink?
Who's that?
Macaulay.
Sit down!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Not with all your money!
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Yes!
Yes.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
I know I left them there.
Home?
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
No, please, not again.
He's not so--
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
Yeah.
Picks up again just on the other side.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Move!
What am I supposed to do?
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
Then step aside.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
I have to answer him.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
There might be something in there.
There might be.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Oh, that's fun.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
Get up off your ass and dig!
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
How!?
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
Sure.
Don't you touch it.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Probably.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
I don't have a weapon.
Shi'ites, I think.
When did you make the switch?
Threatened to blow my brains out?
I don't know.
Really?
He's going to slow down.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I could.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Yeah.  So?
That's in two days.
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, God!
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
I think we found something.
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
Eat your dinner.
I have to... he's a G-34
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
I'll try.
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't know.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
AH UGH.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
We're leaving.
That way.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
No!....
No?
Look more closely.
I thought of something.....
Yes.
Damn.
Just do it.
Hey, look--
Drive.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
Which one's which?
What?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
I know. I warned them.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Nothing so far.
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Quiet!
Huh?
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Sir, I--
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
I didn't. But I had to try.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
You've never been in Constantinople?
Just dull.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I want to see-- 
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Thank you, Major. 
Now just a minute, Major--
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Why should you?
What time is it?
Gaston!
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
The fourteenth of May.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Yes.
You like that statue?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Oh!
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
As you like. 
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Then lunch in the Bois--
How do you like my dress?
Correct!  Good night.
Good night. 
You would?
Like that!
Because I want to make it tough for you.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
I don't believe it!
Giron...!
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
It could have been marvelous ...
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
Please!  Thank you.
About what?
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
I beg your pardon!
That's true.
That's right.
Don't drop it Rose.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Well, here you are.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
She had beautiful hands.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
It's okay. I'm alright.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Glad to see you again.
We'll save you a place at our table.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I don't understand.
Montana?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
I'll say she is!
I could stand some more--
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
There's soft music--
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
What?--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Jimmy!
Not a chance.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
No, sir?
Change?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
I wouldn't be surprised--
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Next month is June.
O.K.! Send that!
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
I thought I put you to bed.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Are you happy?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Very serious?
You don't shoot squirrels.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
What for?
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Thank you.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
I asked where you got him.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
No...
But wait, you don't understand-
Say when.
Enough?  Never.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
But Doc-
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
What?  But I saw 'em-
No.
Colorado's closer
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
What about her?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Fortuitous even.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Always?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Oh, all right.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
But this time they'll be ready.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Fine.  Better.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Yeah, and dangerous.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
I appreciate your time -
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
Sidney Winch.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
What do you mean?
We blast through.
... Yes?
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
- I told you! He was there! -
No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You always got something to say.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
What is it, noontime?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
It's only a tale.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Tolerable well.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
You must have done something to her.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I was just trying to make conversation.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Where?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Go away.
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Not today!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
I can't see a thing!
I dunno.
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Have you been replaced?
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
I was close to being scared that time.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
I thought he was at summer camp!
Uh-oh.
Got it.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
Go away.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
You're late for breakfast.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
He's not here.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Oh, it is?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Yes.
You do?  What else you do?
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Just watch.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Yes, mom --
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
You may speak.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
You're breaking my heart.
Yes, sir!
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
Yeah.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
I'm going home.
Sorry.
Shut up.
Out.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
And don't make any noise.
The point is, you've got to find something new.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Eh? How's that?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
And you might get the fucking job.
Would not say no, would not say no.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
You can look it up.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
What do you mean?
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Yeah.
It wasn't that bad.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Yeah.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It will be your chariot!
It runs deep. Share it with me.
A Federation starship.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Have the Klingons responded?
It's all I have.
The power was within you.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Jim.
Life is not a dream.
Goodnight, Bones.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
He did have pointed ears.
A "t."
"c."... "k."
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
You are mad!
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
I hide no pain.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Did he say why?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Hello, Alan.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I'm sorry -
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Wrote the...?
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Shhhhh.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
How 'bout yourself?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
It grows on you.
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
We have to.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
You seem fine now.
Okay, Dad.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Fine.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Why?
In the helicopter.
No way.  Not Dana.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?

I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
Here they come.
Sorry.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
I'd like that.
Yes what?
Not exactly.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Yeah, it was wild.
What'd you do, honey?
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
No.
Yes.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Are we going to die?
Did you pork her Harry?
Looks that way.
As much as you used to?
And you've got one.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Get going! 
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Fuck you.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
How?
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
This is great, we got cable.
I didn't get any chicken.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Want some Goobers?
Thanks a lot.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yes, I would.
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
You bet. How much is that worth?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
What did he do to Arlene?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Thank you.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Cancoon.
Live with what?
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
I'm her husband.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
In case.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Yeah, OK.
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
I guess so. Follow me.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
What?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
Sure.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
How the fuck could he know?
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Rock whores.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
You're still a little... disoriented.
What's she doing?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Shot!  Who shot you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
What?  What did you say?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I said I was sorry.
Christ!
Think you'll live that long?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You don't fear death?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
Thirty even.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Just a car.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Please, just leave the car alone.
You got the money?
We ain't got no Beck's.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
I . . .
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Sheriff Potter.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
Maybe I don't want you to.
I got it.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Like you.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Such as?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Whatever it takes.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Where?
You live pretty good.
What are you talking about?
There is no us, remember?
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Not me.  Us.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Grace!
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Wait a second--
Ah, I can smell it on you.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
About things.  About your wife.
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
And tell her what?
Is the job done?
No.
You love her, but you hate her?
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
Trouble with the car again?
There's another reason?  It better be good.
That's a thick change of heart.
You're not talking sense.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Get away from me!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
A hundred-forty-five really.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
What for?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Hell no!
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
That a fact?
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Who the hell are you?
Say, what happened to your hand?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Like you don't know.
How do you want it?
No!
Two-hundred dollars?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Darrell--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
You sure you can manage?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Where you headed?
What happens when you lose?
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
The same thing you do.
Like you.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I could if I had Jake's money.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Anywhere?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
The old lady?
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
No baby, you got it wrong.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I have a lock on the door.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Oh shit...
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Jesus.
Think carefully?
What was your idea Elijah?
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Are you for real?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
I'll help you.
How much can you lift?
All of it.
How so?
And what was that explanation?
No?
Advances?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Be careful with those, sonny.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
He's... he's dead.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
I could of... easy.
Oh.
Well, how about it?
What for?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Well... I don't recollect.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
You ain't shot.
Huh?
She gave me the evil eye.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
He hit you?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Worms was comin' out.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Well, I come back, didn't I?
Nothin's bent.
Yeah?
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Hell, yeah.
What was the money for?
Bear with me here...
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
They just said they wanted time.
Alright.
Umm ...
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
They fucking know everything.
Dig.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
What about Redfoot?
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Business or personal?
Where?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
Then why didn't you help him?
He wanted me to live.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
You're joking.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Gruber...
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Yes.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Yes.
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I'm going to uphold that.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
Yes.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand ...
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
It's a common medical term.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
) I'm sorry ...?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
And ask me what?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I'm sure you would.
That's perfectly all right.
Ready, your Honor.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Kathy Price.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Maybe what?
No, no, I'm just...
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Stop pressuring me...
I have to talk to you.
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
...I have to stand up for her...
I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
Admittance form is wrong.
Right.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
The broad has disappeared...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked.
It's locked?
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
One hour.
Yes.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
Well?
Ernie's.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
What about?
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Please! And don't look at me.
Honest?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Is that the best you can do?
Too late. I've got my face on.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
To complete my cure.
But why? Why here?
Madeleine died here.
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
This afternoon.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Good-bye.
How can you be sure?
I don't like them.
Why?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Oh, yes!
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
It wasn't your fault.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Well?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Sorry, old man. Work.
Okay.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
Who?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Yeah.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
What is it, a still life?
How?
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
Name one.
What are you fucking talking about?
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
There's more.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Alright. Let's do it.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They're driving me nuts!
There is no candy!
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I know...
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Lois please.
She's still working?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
What?
I just want to get married.
Just do it.
Yeah.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You have a King fantasy.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Sent it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
You expect more what?
Time out.
Problems?
We're leaving in three hours.
Maybe.
That's sweet.
What are you doing?
I'm working on it.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
What?
Who's dead?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
Move the bodies.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
The wahoo?
What is it?
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
I got to agree with that.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Pup corn?
Okay great. What will that be?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Drum banging real times.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Whatever you like.
Go away! Leave me alone.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Then you won't forgive me?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Well... is it so urgent?
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
Today, a good girl.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
Whatever.
Why would they be going there?
He was a computer program for crissake.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Fine —— you want to stay here?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
Enough to level an entire city block.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
Go to hell.
What you need is a collar.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Relax. I know what you meant.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Enjoying yourself?
I don't know.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Who's got the story? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
I'm working on it.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...what's the Long View?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...this's <u>good</u>...
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
You're tired, Ronnie.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
The War is Over.
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
Out in Oklahoma.
Whaddaya think?
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Dartmouth
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Yeah...?
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
...that's right.
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Of what?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
How's our friend?
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
You got a dime....?
Show Must Go On.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Keep Talking....
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Yes.
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
Is today Laundry Day...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
No, I think..
a "pond," or
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Then get out and close it behind you.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Don't start, alright.
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
What if they call him?
You sure?
What was that?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
What? How do you know about my father?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
I don't understand.
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Are you with me Buddy?
You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Break it.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
You got it, G.G.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
Thank you Jenkins
Allow me sir
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
What?  Tony and China, together?
China
Safety in numbers man.
Hi there Sarah
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Why?
No.  But once I heard...
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
You're joking.
You think that'll help?
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Do you?
No.
You were in an accident?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who?  Your husband?
And then you weren't there.
Um...sure.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
Yeah.
Claire.
I should be going anyway.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Absolutely.
I don't know.
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Hartford?
Please.
If she was dangerous before--
I don't know...
Three weeks.
Nice.  Almost done.
I am, really.
Wanna fool around?
Yup.
Shhh.
Mmm.
Claire...
It's what I've been working for.
Unless you need me to come home...
In the house.  I was scared.
Wow.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
A flare?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
I will NOT.
In the living room...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
Since when?
What?
So you fucked a student?!
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
Don't think so.
Nothing.
But you've not told Michael.
Nothing was ever more false.
What are you talk---
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
You're a monster.
It wes a dream...!
Help us.  Do what you can.
There are things you will not tell him.
If that were true, I would not be here.
I LOVE him!
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
All I meant was -
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Mm-hmm...
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
The one on the left - definitely...
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Sure...
The touch?
No she didn't...
I don't know...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
You've killed but you're not a killer
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
It's what you would do to me
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I think you had better leave
Don't worry about it -
Yes - of course.
Yes...?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
I defy any and all limits.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
I better go, Dad.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
And I was wondering.
Yeah? You like?
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Yeah.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Got it.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
The one with the horses.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Whatever you want.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
You're a peach.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
In what sense?
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
I guess.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
It's all so complicated.
But you never do.
That's refreshingly deviant.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Let your fingers do the walking.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
I'll make you very proud.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I do?
I was like a different person tonight.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
And where might that be?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
About Suzie?
She still work there?
And the child...
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Lombardo's settlement?
Eliminate the competition.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
You could say that.
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
I wanna go home now.
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Curiosity, I guess.
Yes.  God, Mom...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
I won't.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
That's not your line.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
There's nothing for them to get.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You got something against cigarettes?
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
We?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
You need that real often?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
I'll work on it.
Aha?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
My pleasure.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
In the next two minutes?
Yes, me!
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
But it only has six legs.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Really?
You most certainly do.
I don't like to lose, either.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
No, sir... just a businessman.
Dr. Loveless?
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
It is?
When are they coming?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Then come with us.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
I love you.
Madmartigan.
Are you a warrior?
Friend of yours?
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Absolutely!
I did?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
What's the magician's weapon?
His will.
Shut up.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Sorry. It's important.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
It's been a while.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
What have you got?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
Just us.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
It's not a joke.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
No. I'd want a public phone.
I was being foolish?
That's your way, not mine.
Here. Whenever you want them.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
I hear you.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
He's got my number.
Yes, thank you very much.
God, Fred...
His name is John Book.
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
No --
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Oh, now?
My mouth -- my mouth!
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh - I'll get it!
You've had plenty of time already!
Oh, my! 
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Hah!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Where's Kansas?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
What?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Now...
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
It's a whatzis?
You don't neither --
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
No, her dog!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Quiet!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh --
Oh, no!
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
Makes her look even more innocent.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
She’ll get over it.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
...you should rest.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
Of course...
Please.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
No idea who's behind this?
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Wrong answers?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Cured, yes.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I¹m not.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Laurie --
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
The costumes.  Am I right?
That's because --
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
Where did he go?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
"Anarchy" 99"?
We hung out last night, remember?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Why you dogging me up?
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
A parachute. This does not argue well.
This is a gift. From me to you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Were you now?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
I'll go.
It does indeed, Max.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Baack!
Surprised?
Of course.
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Does that mean you love me?
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Yes!... the laboratory.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Why did you do that?
I didn't do that.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
I see.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
There wolf!  There castle!
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Did you hear that strange music?
I have a pretty good idea.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
If you like -- just hurry!
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
You've got it, master.
It wasn't me.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Act casual!
How do you know it was a 'he'?
There's only one way.
How nice.
What a filthy mess.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Give him the sedative!
I see what you mean.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
MMmmm.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
