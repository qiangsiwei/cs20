Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
She okay?
Great
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
What if she never starts dating?
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Get out!
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
I thought you hated those people.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
You and Verona?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You -- covered in my vomit.
This is so patronizing.
I told you
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Busy
No, you weren't
I should do this.
Unwelcome.
What?
No one else knows
No, I won't go with you
You tell me.
It's just something I had.  You know
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Was that your sister?
Bianca did what?
Macbeth, right?
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Absolutely not.
We should have seen land.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
I haven't given you much of a life.
She said yes.
You don't usually ask.
How far from here?
I have to explore the mainland.
Father...
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I knew you would.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You bloody...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Where are we going?
What about Oleg?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
So you were never a prostitute?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
What's he looking for?
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Yeah.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Alright.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Hi, I'm Honey.
What?
Why not?
Let me get a shot of it.
No, I don't get that!
I can get you a job.
What are you doing here?
Isn't he a little moody?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
I know.
Well, he...
I'll take him.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Clean?
Yeah?
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
You're kidding.
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
And don't you worry about it.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Thank you, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
And your charming little daughter?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
You're in a hurry.
Would you guys...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
You made that move, huh?
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Why?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
So do you...been a long day.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
What am I wanted for?
Great place for lunch.
Jack, are you okay?
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Hey, I don't believe it.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Shut up.
Stall.
Yeah, old times.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
He's a she!
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Good luck..
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
It's a miracle!!!
What's she doing?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Who?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
How do I look?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...Priest...
Hello?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
He's on vacation.
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Apipoulai!
Learning language.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
The cash man!
It's not?
Talk English Doc.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Hello?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
Tom...
I'm telling you...
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Is that him?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
I'm not so sure about this.
Any good?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How much did he pay you?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Where?  Show me where.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
I'm listening.
You are a private investigator?
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Enlighten me.
Give me the film.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not a cop.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Twenty-five.
Who is he, his name?
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
It won't work like that.
You're joking.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
No...
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
You alright?
I can't go back to sleep again.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Rick, please.
So?
Been up with Alice.
What's wrong with me?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Are you alright?
But how are we gonna --
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I thought about that.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
But I've seen her grave.
Poor woman...
Vomit?
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Well?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What course, Skipper?
The frogmen?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Who with?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Are you alright, Wade?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
Oh.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Guaranteed, eh?
I'm okay.
They said.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
What?
Do what?
You know.
I called Mommy.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
I know.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
Where's the plow?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Want to buy?
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You knew me as a kid.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
This is nuts.
There's a furnace.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Marg!
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Rolfe.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
That it wasn't an accident.
Wade, are you alright?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
I'm sure he's busy.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
It's cut.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
How many others killed?
why did they do that?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Where are we now?
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
*                     Please tell me your name.
Do you have to be so brutal?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
That was war.
You'll do it?
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
How did your speech go?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
What are you doing?
We're under attack.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
What's the story?
What is it, Mary?
Elaine.
Te...!
Ted, we're taking off!
Elaine, we have to go back.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Simon just ejected!
Set!
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Maybe.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
That's not possible.
Go ahead.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Can I hold him?
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Surely there must be something you can do.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
What's the matter?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
We'd better get back now.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
How ya doing, honey?
Yes?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Roger.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You don't have squat.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
What is wrong?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Did you learn anything?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Did you talk to him?
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
In the other man's rectum.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
What was that about?
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
We all did.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
No!  We must do this alone.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
What is it?
You think this is the guy who did it?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Ss'kya'ta'.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Yeah, Sykes?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
How long until it blows?
You did okay, Bishop.
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
I don't know.
We got problems.
Let's go!  Let's go!
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
They're in the approach corridor.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Range twenty meters.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
His Grace is very angry with you.
Is there a part for me?
Where?
Why?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
I want to go!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Do you think that's funny?
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
What?
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Stanzi!
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Who was that?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
These are originals?
This is not his handwriting.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
May I try it?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Oh, thank you.
Majesty!
Why so?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Twenty-six.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Yes, sir.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
Why not?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Papa!
Not that I've seen.
What medicine?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Put it down!
No.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Yes?
I have come to commission work from you.
What?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
What?
You go fast!
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
You mean in Turkey?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
What do you want?
No, you didn't!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
What anger?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
I'll call tomorrow.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
He's not?
Warn him?
What shall we do?
It wasn't a lunatic.
Mr. Kessler?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
I'm twenty-seven.
Yes, go on.
Hello. You all right?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
The bedroom.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
He all right?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Now see here young man.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Alex?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
There were witnesses?
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
You're talking about the woman I love.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
I assume full responsibility.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
It's in front of us.
It sounds far away.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I'm going completely crazy.
What?!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
It's you, David.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Nurse!
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
What's that?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
No.
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Whose death?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Say, you can't do that—
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why not?
know, but—
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Line?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
The theatre?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes, thank you.
I haven't any.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Mine too?
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
What's keeping you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Did you talk to him?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Where's Charlie?
This is healing?
He's smiling.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
I ain't done --
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Beg pardon?
He's been full of vinegar lately.
How?
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Yep.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I got us through the War all right.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
I had you covered.  From back there.
My little Web did that?
They're gone. What are you --
I reckoned.
"Big and older"?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
And we're good at it.
If I could go back to farming --
Uncle Frank?
Jesse, are you awake?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Little ones.
Let the law --
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
"Hmm" what?
Let me see that.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Yes?
You okay, Jesse?
Not at all.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
How much did they get from the safe?
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Courtney? Dinner?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
I haven't seen you around here.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Get married. Have a wedding.
Is your Evian spiked?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
Because he dated her.
You saw the ad in the Times?
Yes, naturally.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Uh huh.
Patrick? Is that you?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
What?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Dorsia.
We are totally booked.
Late?
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Patrick?
Anywhere you want?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Jean? Sorbet?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
A model? An actor?
That's...that's too bad.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Paul Owen.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Hmmm.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Marcus?
I'm not...
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Is that a raincoat?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
That took some fun out of --
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What!
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Don't we have any chopsticks?
That'll be a test, won't it?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
...When did you know?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
I do!
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
You did this -- overnight?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
...Worse?
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Wait... He knows.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Did I say something?
Did you wanna be alone?
Why would you do a thing like --
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
I met this girl.
What does that mean?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
Is it about my teeth?
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Good luck, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Yes?
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What's the other?
What?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
My wedding tackle.
My meat and two veg.
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Why?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I have something to tell you.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Noooooooooooooo!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Ow! You shot me!
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
You didn't...
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
No, he's really evil.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Red ...
... death ...
Love...
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Then who wins?
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
No thanks.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
You mean my other self ...
What on earth?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Yes ... ?
Winning isn't everything.
You don't trust me?
You lied.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Aren't you coming?
I'll be back ...
Where are you going?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Mrs. Peel?
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
I shall need a small plane.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Steed
Possibly. Split personality ...
Are you alright, young man?
Let it be rain, please let it be --
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
Cole...
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
God, you're a slob.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Are you going to have women at your party?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
That feels so great.
Your mother's not dead.
Let go of me!
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Let's get naked.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
What are you talking about, asshole?
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
What the hell are you doing?
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
About what?
Wash it to the windows?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Yeah...
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Saw what?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I know.
I'll handle it.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
With grenadine, right?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
You think that's really any of your business?
Okay.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
I want another shot, Sir.
I need another one, sir.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
No need to be modest, Brian.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
So, you surviving without me?
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
He's got piano lessons.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Knock it off. Now.
Got a cause?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Nah...
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Ho!
Give me some?
Delacroix.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
What's that?
Seconds and thirds, too.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Good morning, Cheeba.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
I won't do it anymore.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
That's a great handle.
What are there character traits?
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
How did you end up here?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
How did you know?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
What point is that?
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
Is that good or bad?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Hi, Mona.
Can I kiss you too?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
No.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Peerless, your father called.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
I fell out of my bed last night.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
What else?
Oh you do, huh?
No, before my time.
Never read a book in my whole life.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Good morning.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Is Miss Dugan well?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Then you yield to me.
That is a trifle strong.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
Agreed.
I feel the ribbon.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Yes?
Is he all right, papa?
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You framed-him...
Yeah, right...
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Some.
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Why?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
You hated West more than any of us.
Oh, come on --
I didn't kill him --
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Something funny, Levi?
I don't know --
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
That's horseshit and you know it.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
Stay where you are.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
You and the Colonel go back.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Excuse me?
You made me look like an idiot --
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Why do you care?
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
We're fucked, I know --
Are you sure?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
Yeah.
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
We should tell him we're not going.
We just want --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
What happened with Nunez?
I used it to start the fire --
The fuck are you talking about --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
Sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
I have to leave. Tonight.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
You won't find a better place!
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I brought it.
Can I see him?
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
So I've heard.
In so many words, yes.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I was dreaming.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
I like your stories.
Really?
I can.
Am I?
She was a witch.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
How did you know my father?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
You need to go.
That's because most of it never happened.
I need you on my side.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
What?
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
Ch...
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
I'm asking what you're here for.
I need to know who you are first please.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
What was that?
Do you believe in love?
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
Is that everything?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
Today is bath day.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
You don't understand anything.
I don't want to know.
Where's the restroom?
What? No you're not..
What?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
It wasn't what I wanted.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Have you had any before?
What?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Except for Small Eyes.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Why?
My name's Sophia.
Thanks.
Yes?
You take her to a doctor?
What do you need?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
You been home yet?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
How long... how long I been out?
Two days?
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
You take it straight?
Could you do somethin' for me?
By myself?
Looks like you know a song.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
This Rae... you get with her?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
What'chu sayin'?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Please don't tell my daddy.
So...  That your first time?
What's on your mind?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
What's this?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Nick... You up?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Getting very weird.
Cool?
All right, how's the new partner?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Nick!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
Did I say that?
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
I'm not drunk...
A resort city, Beppu.
Nick, you can't do this.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Ich said you left.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
He drinks.
She's such a long way home for you.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
He killed a police officer.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
And what can he do for you?
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
I've done some questionable things.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
What generation are you?
Show me something?
What was he after?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
I was just about to have my dinner.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Yeah.  I got it.
Why, yes, of course.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Not if it works.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Huh huh.
You sure?
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
The best.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It's artificial?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Why not?
Dead.
Like?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Is this to be an empathy test?
May I ask a personal question?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
Pris.
Where are your folks?
They left.
Beautiful.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
Your mom was a dancer?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
How do you do?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
How's that?
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
How long would you need me?
I guess we'll need another locker.
A wife?
One who's not a mutant.
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
May I please be excused?
The what?
Hey, Eve!
What about her?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
I don't blame you!
Uh-huh. Adam?
Yes, Eve?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
A card?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Like a painting?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Yeah?
Yes. He likes windows.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
What?!
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
Does that work?
You dial nine to get out.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Right.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
He drank it hot?
Well, put it down and come in!
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Home sweet home!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Oh, no.
Calvin?!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
I think...it...works.
To bed?
Yes, you do!
I don't think so.
Gay.
What do you want to do with it?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
We came back to the house!
What?!
Where?!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
I've seen a few.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What is this? What color is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Do you like talk like that?
Sure I'm alright. 
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Then don't talk about killing.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Do you like my body?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
You called me Jeffrey.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Frank gone?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
On a ride.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
I'm going out for awhile.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hi Dad.
Oh yeah?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Maybe so.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
You worry about me really?
Where to?
Really?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Look under the body.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Would someone please come over here and...
Aye.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
For what?
I'm serious.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
And number three, Dolly.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So what are you thinkin' here?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
You bet your ass he will.
Yes.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
You're right.
I believe these young men are right.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Have you no fear of God?
Father, I'll do you right here.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
He's a nigger.
OK. That's wrong.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Eight dollars.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Where's the manager?
Is that the manager?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
I don't want to use it.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Obviously. That's a given.
When'd he tell you?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
What?
Shh.
Sixteen dollars.
He doesn't want to fight.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
He did?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Are you afraid?
Exactly. Woah.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Cuba.
Uh-uh.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
That's Anthony.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
What?
Are you a fag?
So who's going to know?
What did I say?
I think we might of scared her.
You really think he'll remember you?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
What the fuck possessed you?
Yes, I do.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Dignan.
Bob, you're lying!
Wait a second --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Why?
No. I just have short hair.
You like Chicanos?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
There was a mistake.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Had to be done.
What do you have, Danny?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
I'll get the book.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Sleep. Sleep now.
No... How?
Where --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
What?
Why is she trying to kill me?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
What do you mean?
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
You're sure?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
So he fooled you.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
Did you?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
Longshanks promised!
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
You know it's a trap.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
You'll move
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
I have faced him. Have you?
I do not confess.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I need you so much! I love you!
How do you know this?
It's battle I want, not talk.
Why did you?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
They've tricked us.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Can't he come out for one day?
All the dads are gonna be there.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Why do you ask?
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
Oh God... what did we do?
Not since we were kids.
So how's Tommy?
Of course.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Where... where are my clothes?
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Are you okay?
I get it. You can drop it now.
What's happened to you?
Why's that?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Smells like sex in here.
It didn't feel like a dream.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Look what you made me do!
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Huh?
Shut up, Tommy!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Yes, Monsieur.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, Monsieur.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Goodnight.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, good luck, yes.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
We said "no questions."
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
I didn't count the days.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Where is Rick?
Does he always leave so early?
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
-- Yes?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
How do you do?
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
My office.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
You love her that much?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
May we proceed with the business?
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Even in Berlin.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Hello, Louis.
Yeah? What's his name?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Manages what?
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Sam's piano.
I have. Sit down over there.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
What is your nationality?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Get me the Radio Tower!
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
No.
Shut up and go home, will you?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
It's bad.
Nobody remembers that.
Can't.  Need water.
Thirsty.
No.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
They're harder to do than they look.
What brings you out to the sticks?
You?  Personally?
I've got lots of time.
You know, for when you travel.
This isn't working out.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Her name's Hannah.
There was a coffin?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Yeah?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
You're Chuck Noland.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Kamal is not here.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
And never take.
Forget it.
For the third time.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
It's me.
To Wilson.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
That's what it's about.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Burma!
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
How is that Wally doing?
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
Is *your* father dead?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
It's almost like flying.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
But she's your *daughter*...
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
I'm stayin', Homer.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
It's obviously an aborticide.
I haven't read that.
Where's the name sheet?
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Of course.
You're not yet three months, are you?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
So, what do you do?
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
We had to finalize the deal.
This has to happen fast.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
Whoa. What?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Sorry, I --
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
No.  What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
Don't worry about it.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Uh... Everything okay?
I gotta go get a haircut.
Lighten up.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
Then shut up.
Why?
We never had a problem with that before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Him.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Ten percent.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Did he buy it?
That's it?
To who?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
You trust this Moonan guy?
What are you doing?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I'll take you up on that.
Why did you quit?
You called the casino a cesspit.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
All right. As what?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
How's that football story corning along?
I couldn't resist them.
You really are a beautiful woman.
Where did you get it?
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
What's the time?
Do you have to swear all the time?
You're my conscience.
I don't like it.
Marion. It's a book.
Leave it.
I hope it brings you luck.
What?
Never. Why do you ask?
Why did you take the money?
What?
It's not that.
Near the casino.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Which side do you like?
I didn't.
The point is, they want a man inside.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
How are you?
Detective Inspector Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
Are you going to put a spell on me?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Who are these guys?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Has he?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Five.
What makes you so sure?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
Ever?
Very impressive.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Thanks.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Of course.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Exactly.
Why don't you have more time?
Out where?
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
No kidding?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Who are you?
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Who's Camille?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Thank God.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Wasn't that hard.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
It was open.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
The other ones?
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Well, not me personally.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You're also a fool.
Say the words, "I understand."
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
As long as you're okay.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Yeah.
How long you and me known each other?
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Playing hooky again?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Exactly.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
I'm a toy to her.
--a philandering pig.
You love him?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
No problem.
We've got to take this slow...
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
I think we should try sneaking in.
I found the Volvo.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Oh, hi, mom.
Ahh, sunshine.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
No.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
What happened?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
When can I squeeze one out?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
I am so sorry.
How old is Grandma Death?
Wanna walk me home?
Where are you going?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, shit!
What's "Cellar Door"?
He said to follow him.
Yes.
How are things going at school?
What else do you think about during school?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
How many times have you seen Frank?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
The good stuff.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
What else makes you feel regret?
Then how is time travel possible?
Frank is going to kill.
I can see him right now!
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Gerald.
That's enough.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
What is this shit?
No more fuckin' for her.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Really?
Loretta, don't do that.
Amber? Here.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Your parents'd kill you.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Go on! Get out!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
This, this... This is bullshit!
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
Shut it up, Loretta.
So? Be real easy.
Wisconsin.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
I will if you shut your piehole.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
He should be king!
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
What's the matter with you?
Have you got a license?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yankee Poodle.
Did you shoot the rapids?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
My card.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Sure.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Uncle, you can't do this!
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
John loves the house.
You stay with me.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
What happened?
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
I want him back!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Treves. Well done.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
You're English.
Yes.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
The main spire.
Yyyess.
Hello...
Righteousness...
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Yes, John.
Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Yes, very soon.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Well... where is he?
I said welcome.
WHY?
We never went to bed together.
We mustn't let him land!
Who?
Erik. You don't understand.
But you don't realize....
Of course.
But --
Would you like us to sing to you?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
I didn't mean to!
Why?
We're missing all the fun...
She got me thinking...
SHUT UP!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Row!
I've got you!
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
But HOW?
ROW!
I came to find my grandfather.
You will wait?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Relax!
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
He drove me mad!
Easy, Dad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Yes, Mum.
In the room?
Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Rockville Center.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Probably see you at the book store.
You're sure? It's cold.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Take care.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Very much.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Do you remember what we talked about?
What was I wearing?
I dropped you off after. You said --
Come up and see me... now.
Is that what you want?
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Oh God, how horrid.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
yeah?
Seems too coincidental that way.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Male or female?
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I think we should go.
Bye, Joel.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just walked in.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
How's the chicken?
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Oh! Great. That's great!
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Where?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
How do you mean?
Is that Nietzsche?
What, Howard?
Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
I tried that already.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
She likes you okay.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Clockworks.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
You don't?
You're political, then?
No, I guess not.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
What do you think?
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
Ballast.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
You weren't there. I saw it.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
Please... kill...
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
That's a negative, Starck.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
What does it say?
I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
Yes...
I don't know...
I don't know...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
What are you talking about?
You know.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Jesus...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
We don't have time to fart.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Now what?
No, no, we just got her back together...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
No. It was someone else.
Go ahead.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
It's cold.
The safety circuit's failed!
You can't do that.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
What are you doing here?
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
I had it at four.
You got a chisel round here?
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
No more cracks about how I look.
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
That's good. That's uh... good.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
What are you doing here?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
You want to work at Carl's?
It's the first door on your left!
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Well... it's true.
Does Mom know you have company?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Well, I've gotta be running.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
You'll always remember your first time.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
That little prick.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
You just ripped my card in two!
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I don't know. I guess so.
Where do you feel like going?
That's a nice shirt.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Do you know what you want?
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
Anything to drink?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Oh, my God!...
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
How long do I have?
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
The cops?
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Lucy.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
It's gone too far.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll be back.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Where's that?
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
We just smeared a skunk.
Fuck you too.
Scared?
No. You?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your parents of relation?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
He's dead.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Will these boards hold?
Welcome back.
Clever fuckers.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Not without you!!!
I admire your strength.
I'll do anything to help.
Did we make it?
I'm not lying.
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
What's up?
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
You learn your lines?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
...I see.
Were you an alcoholic?
No.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Of course.
And you think it's worth all this?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
You sound as if you hate it.
Don't touch me.
Okay then...
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
What happened to him?
Frances...
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
Serious, huh?
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Think I'll have a glass.
And?
Where are we, mean man?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Yeah. I don't know.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Who're you?
The speech? Real good.
Why are these all opened?
How long will you be?
At one. Promise?
Don't... talk crazy.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Please sit down...
Is there something else?
You're telling me you feel guilty.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
No!
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Better that way... for me.
Come warm yourself if you like.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Materials. Nothing more.
She's not for you.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Your decision. For us.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
So do I.
Brother and sister no more.
Victor!
Can you think of a better reason?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
No. He had more important work.
Yes? And?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Why?
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Who are you?
The killer is still out there.
We should go now.
You draw very well.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Alice? The others show up?
I'll go take a look.
I'll go check on Brenda.
What about Neddy?
Girls can't be cowboys.
You okay?
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Have you ever been there before?
I said new, this is an '90.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Yes.
She's dead?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Was? As in not anymore?
You won't let him touch her?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Pass.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
I'm going for 'em!
What did I say?
Yes.
Are you okay?
We have to go back for Daddy!
How many bullets left, kid?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Best in Mexico.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
How do you know?
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
No, I didn't.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
Where are you right now?
That's what I hear.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Don't say my name.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Shit.  Think we're had.
"The Lark Report."
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Just do it, okay?
I'll try anyway, sir.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"In Washington..."
Whose orders were those?
He was married?
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
She part of the training?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
'Cool?
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
That why you dumped him?
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
I'll take them all.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Circuits are overloaded.
How do you know?
My life sucks.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Can I use some?
You're fast.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Are you looking for this?
Sounds like a big company.
Why do you need that?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
It's Raymond.
Just don't.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Thanks.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Don't speak, Quellek.
Come on, old friend...
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Nothing.
He wants to THINK!?
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
And note the sucked in gut.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Oh.  Okay.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
It's okay. Listen-
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Up.
There is no weather in space.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
It's Jason...
But I'm the Commander!
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Jason..
How does the rolling help, actually?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Gwen...
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
You... You mean Earth?
Theramin.
But what if Sarris survives?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Okay... On what?
It doesn't have eyes.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Continue forward, sir?
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Oh, come now...
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
The British army, sir!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
And how rusty are these muskets?
I rode here, on my horse.
Surely you knew this was coming.
I'm very aware of that.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
I think I heard that.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
We're leaving them?
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
What the hell are we doing?
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Where... do those men come from, George?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
You're out of your mind!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
That's good... who?
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
I guess still in the locker.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
You get the money?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
You can talk to me.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Who?
You say look at you?
That's right.
I'm in the movie business.
I'm a producer.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
I want you to.
So he comes to L.A...
Ever shot anybody.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
What?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
He died.
Yeah, he told me.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Who told you that?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's not one of these?
We call you a taxi.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
I told you not to -–
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Really.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Roger?
Try Wednesday.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
The right way and the wrong way.
How long, then?
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Dodge to Murphy.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Don't lie to me!
Morning everybody.
You mean, before she sank.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
There's somebody else on this boat.
Same. Any luck?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
They went crazy.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Call the Coastguard?
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
You don't remember?
Oh, man.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
A what?
Can't find the shotgun.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Uh-oh.
What do you mean?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Are you the one who left that note?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
How perfect.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Hi.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
So what should we do?
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
Are you sure?
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
How about this one?
Give me all your money, bitch!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
How repulsive!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Well, we won't keep you.
Who does?
You still interested in that?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Didn't they tell you?
Go die, asshole!
...are you waiting for a bus?
Fine, and how are you?
I did too!
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Yeah, well...
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Every guy has a type!
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
PLEASE? We have to!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Boo!
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Does that mean you don't like me?
Where did you get this?
I'm just being realistic.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Please Josh?
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know... where is she, then?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Yes?
Morning, friend, glorious day.
How; we don't know where they are?
You've never built in Africa.
Pleasant journey?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
Understand, I had help-
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Don't much like them.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
What?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
Goddammit!
But of course yours worked.
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
You like him, don't you?
Where is it?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
That's where the buggy stopped.
So this is what you do, huh?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Should we go?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
I command you.
These boys aren't playing around.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Like what?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
From where -- Neptune?
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
This is what you do with your spare time?
Like a goat on garbage.
What kind of tests?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Now where are you going?
Are you the Gatekeeper?
No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
Uh-huh.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
That is one speedy mutt.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Print is dead.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I think it's the food of the future.
What is it?
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
In a storage facility.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
May I please see the storage facility?
Yes.  I don't like this.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
I'm always serious.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
She said he was "the Destructor."
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Boy, that was a rough one.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Those are priceless sculptures.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
I am their hero!
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
The Senate too?
You're hearing about somebody else.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
Tomorrow?
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
My troops don't make policy.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Take your hands off me animal!
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
You get to come alive again in the country!
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you always drive like this?
No -- why should I?
Will you take me home now?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Where we going?
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
All right.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What?
I'm meeting someone.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Here? In Berkeley?
What?
Did you say rape her?
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
What are you looking for?
The marble?
We just can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
657-2036
Yes, I will.
You a student?
What?
I'm in the bathroom.
I'm putting it here by the door.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Where is your luggage?
Oh no.
No. 
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
What's wrong?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Yes.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
But they would! Don't you see?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Would you like me to seduce you?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Oh my God.
Do you understand what I said?
Hello, Benjamin.
He didn't see me.
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
Why don't you get it.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Will you bring me a hanger?
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
You can admit that, can't you?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
No.
What?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Is it?
See if you can guess.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yes.
What?
No.
No.
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Drive down the block.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Now it seems to me --
I say I've got it.
Braddock -- Braddock?
Oh, no.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
I do.
I guess -- about my future.
Say that again.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Mr. Robinson?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
And what are you going to do?
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls?
What about the money?
Of course.
I'd given you up.
Chasing what?
Nothing -- only to be here.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
That's a silly joke.
I don't want them now.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Ready, Kringelein?
You've lost everything?
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
I thought she was splendid!
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Send his bags up to my room.
You're tired. I can see that.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
No - absinthe.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
You dance splendidly.
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
What?
Later?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Tired?
You...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
How nice -- your daughters?
Hello!
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
A thousand marks -- 
Can you pay some attention to me?
Why not?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Last night?... There was no applause.
He will be on the train.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Yes, the police must be called.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
My son was in the hospital --
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You're calling the shots.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
What's up?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Just myself.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
They knocked out my tooth!
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Up to you.
Sure.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
I tripped over a chair.
Get off the grift, Roy.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
As though you do what I say.
At what?
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
You want a drink?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Mm?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
That's just Lilly's way.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
I've heard the name.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
Where?
Upstate.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
What?  What for?
You were gone for a while.
I saw her.
What?
That's what I say.
For Christ's sake, why not?
Bullshit!
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
What?
Ate the gun. Oh.
Oh, Jesus.
No question, huh?
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
It's Amy Kramer.
Another historical inaccuracy.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Thanks!
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Let the party begin.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
He says things.  Bad things.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mommy, I'm scared.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Danny?!  Danny!
Come on!
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
This is madness, Wynn.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
The hell with the diamonds!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I'm liable to find anything!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
The educational process.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Go to the funeral?
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
How are you, honeybunch?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
To make an ass of yourself.
Gee whiz--
As a matter of fact--
Dr. Woodly.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Man and boy.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Sir?
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
Can't it keep till morning?
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Can I get dressed first?
"Hamburger Heaven."
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Say hello to your mother.
Now that's what I call fun.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Why not?
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
She's fine.  Please--
I feel the same way.  What next?
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
What brought you back?
Yes.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Now who's being cruel?
I'm high as a kite.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
With spittle?
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
What is this thing that kills me?
What are you going to do?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
So long, you guys.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Thank you, kind sir.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
That's something I suppose.
I see.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Is he coming home?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
How long has this been going on?
I'm sorry.
It's true.
You and Harold are friends?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
That's the XKE.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
Meaning?
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Just one.
Hello. You want some information?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Nah.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
Huh?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
A friend.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Hmm.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
What are you doing here?
Do the police want to arrest me?
Yeah, sure.
What happened, pilgrim?
Is Marsha there?
What?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
No.
I want to meet Ratan.
Well...
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You never heard of that?
I'm worried about Jake.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Jake'll take care of me.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
No.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
I'm a file clerk.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
I don't know.
Nice to meet you.
What?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Oh, at the dentist's?
All right.
Yes. Very much.
You look as if you could.
You don't look eighty.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Oh, my. We're too late.
Thank you.
No more revolts.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
What is it, Harold?
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Oh, you weren't scared.
- end where I began.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
I feel giddy.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
To whom?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Do you play?
Just give me a rough estimate.
A rough estimate.
Does that worry you?
Ah, yes.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Another man's life in your sights.
Eh?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Julia.
It's a beautiful dress...
What?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Steve...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
Don't get psychic with me.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
You are a Catholic??
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Me?? C'mon --
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
-- should go back. Now!
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
No. I never was.
What was that??
Where do you --
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Not from you.
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Hi.
Red, I --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Marco...
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
He's just pushy.
Cocky.
I know.
Yes, I --
We're leaving.
Alright, let's give it another try.
Got her mother's looks.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
You did this before, right?
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
This isn't happening.
Poor baby.
Well?
I don't want to see the dress.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
Kirsty.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
Take it slowly.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
What's wrong with you?
What's going on?
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Oh Christ.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
I've forgotten.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I guess.
It's like she's waiting for something.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
I want to see.
I won't be able to stand.
You're not going?
I thought we'd lost you.
What do we do if there isn't?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
Are you busy after work ?
Steve. Thank God you came.
You gotta be kidding me.
Not the point.
Oh, so what's the point then?
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
We can take your car.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
No way.
What?
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
I have all of the others.
Well what about the new Echo --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Anna Moss.
Pardon me?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
Is that it?
Nice friend.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Rob --!
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Well we rang $900 today.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Shit!
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
What were the others?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Hi.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Sure they are.
I can't talk right now.
I don't want to go back.
Laura...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Let's go home.  Okay?
But what?
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
How're you holding up?
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
So you'll stay?
That way.
So so.  Up and down.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
But you must have --
Seventy-five.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
He'd want to know about all this.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Why?
-Okay okay.
Byzantine?
Who?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
Have you gone to the police?
You are being foolish.
You're wrong.
Yes.
Maybe it would do us both good.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
That would be difficult to explain.
That's insane.
You killed those other two.
Come here, Brenna.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Afternoon.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
You are the same?
It is less.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
I'm twenty-two.
It is the truth.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
I'm your future husband, remember?
Some think not.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
No doubt.
Finish yours?
Must he go?
My father taught me.
Where!
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Are you here?
This your present address?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
You're a kind man to be sure.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Yes, wasn't it?
Hildy!
Yes!
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, I'm independent, too.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Done what?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Exclusive? That's great.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I know, but --
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Hildy!
Double-crossing swine!
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
What happened?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
No, you don't! Walter!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
In a way.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
It'll be Heaven!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
What?
Let's see the money.
They're always after me for interviews.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Just one second --
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
What?
Shoot to kill, I said.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
You'll take fifty and like it!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Who is it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
You know it is!
Hiding him where?
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Don't forget about production for use.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
How'd you get here, Earl?
Hey --
For heaven's sake, why not?
Here's the picture of my wife.
A very fine-looking women.
What's your hurry?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Bugger off.
Who with?
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
What's that?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Where?
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Up to six weeks, I think.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
We did the decent thing.
I wish it could all have been different.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Tiny's home.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
You know... a couple of queers.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
What!
And...
Is that all... think real hard.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
That's nice.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
So what?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
You got to be fucking joking.
What was that?
I don't hear anything.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
What'd ya got there?
Open up the trunk.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Yes, sir.
That's it?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Over.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Shall we close up, then?
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Gabby, what is it?
I just want to talk.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
No.
You what?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
One night stand?
No. I married a midget.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Oh, Rosie.
Oh, Rosie.
I'll be in touch.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
I'm not sure.
It looks wonderful.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I'll be out in a minute.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
What?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Come on.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Yahoo!
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Yes?
Yep.
Mm hmm.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
I've never been to Louisville.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
Are you ready for another?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Oh, about five hundred.
Hey, mister.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
I told you. I got drunk.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Man named Turk Baker?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Hey, Findley's here.
When do I raise the bet?
Half.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Aaaahhhh!
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Who's he?
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Well... well, now.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
You quittin' too?
Long wait for a bus?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Oh, cut my finger.
What's this supposed to mean?
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Is he a winner?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
No, I want to walk.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Why should I?
Why?
Well, what's the matter?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Thousand dollars a game.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Mine.
What's inside?
Shhh... don't talk.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
You built things.
What's that, Dad?
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Is the hill ours too?
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
It was so real, Dad.
I'm home now.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I'd believe him.
What is it?
When?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
Oh?
What do you want?
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What do you want me to do?
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
You saved a lot of lives.
What's the bad news?
What're you talking about?
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
With their shields down it might be possible.
A meteor?
How do you know?
He's trying to impress you.
Yes, I am.
Sorry for what?
So, what do you do for a living?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
We're already over Mach 2!
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
They let you out?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Many worlds...
Peace? No peace.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Venice, Italy!
That doesn't look much like a library.
That was our assessment as well.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Don't call me that, please.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
Umh?
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
What?
Those people are trying to kill us!
Dad?
The penitent man is humble before God.
After you, Junior.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Why are you trying to kill us?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Who are you?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Charming.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
You think so?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
I ride with you, Indy?
Indy, look!
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
No.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Give me the stones!
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Long ago -- before my father's father.
You don't look very good.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Can you move your arm?
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
What does the writing say?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
What?!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Yes.
I get it!
I said something.
My name is AL.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Do me a favor, Al.
My place, can't you see?
No.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
I just went there for a job.
I'll tell you what to say.
Behind us?
I wouldn't say that.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Did you hear that?
Now what.
Take a left and your next right.
Why not?
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
What is it?
.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
But what's it look like?
Follow that busboy.
Even Rene?
You're doing great with her.
And on my time.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Where are you going?
Ow!
I can't see a thing.
Never mind, just say it.
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Probably.
Are you alright?
Be quiet.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
I have been... I think you're right.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
What part what?
In him?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
What Job?
Sir?
We met on the beach.
Enough ROmance.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
It may have been affected.
When you do...
Well what?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
What?
Then who did?
Oh...and who is it!?
Blake said that?
Why?
...and sort of...disinterest.
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
Why do you do it?
...Naw. Made that up.
What did you tell them?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
Why?
You know where he went?
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
Where what?
Hong Kong.
I know the territory.
So do I.
I can't fly it.
Are you alright?
That I really don't know.
What a mess.
You can say that again. What do we do?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Now what?
You are, I've seen you.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Why'd you invite me here?
What about the others.
Is there anything else?
It's alright.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
When's your deadline?
Monday.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Alright, alright.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Okay. 
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Come again?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Lowell?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Thomas Sandefur...
What's going on?
"60 Minutes"?
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
No, you do not.
That's right...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
We're there.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
Thank you for saying that...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Oh, please, Mike...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Should I just take the documents now?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's not the point.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Right.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
A delivery device for nicotine.
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
So she's uh, flourishing?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
That's his lawyer.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
You're in check.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
I assume this is on Rex?
Not yet.
How do you know?
You just haven't met the right person.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Screw you, asswipe!
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Thank you.
Hmmm...
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Huh?
You do?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Fabric and fringe.
You don't like me?
Those are gifts.
Hello Miles.
It's not something I wanted either.
Sweet.
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Do you know him?
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
But you're going through with it?
Well, that's about to change big time.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client has ruled that out.
...arty farty!
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Who's "Patty."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Oh—Mary—
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
You're a peculiar chap.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Oh, hello, Dad.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Nothing. 
Oh, no.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Oh, no—no.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
They're practically all the same, sir. 
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
I never thought of that.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Beat it! 
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Outside!
Like what?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
I'm following you.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Of course it is.
Not a one.
Oh, Peter— 
What's got into you?
was so scared—that it scared—
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You think it's simple, huh?
Clever.
Here comes a car!
Eat a carrot.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
What happened?
That's swell!
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, by the way—what's your name?
What's 'at?
Yeah!
Huh?
Get out of here!
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Yeah.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Collect?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
That's right.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Why—no—
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Right.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Who?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Yeah, I guess you do.
Keep saying what?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
Where you going, boss?
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
I see.  And where did you drive?
And then Sunday?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
I had the cause of death.
There were admirals.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No, you don't!
I want the truth.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
I wouldn't imagine where.
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
Honey, you all right? 
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Get a hold of yourself.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
They killed him, honey.
Oh no!... How bad?
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Post Office.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
You know who the mayor was?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
That's all you've had all this time?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
I can't believe you do me this way.
Fine.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
I'd love one, but not there.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ordell pick up his bond?
He's got that kinda money?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
What'dya think?
You get a chance to use it?
'76?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Why?
What're you, a bag lady?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Did you do it that night?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
He's liable to shoot you.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I didn't use you, Max.
We're partners.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Not really.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
What did you do after that?
Oh, hi.
Sure.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I just came here to talk.
I got a problem...
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Didja tell 'em anything else?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
The roller disco one.
No.
You lived in Japan, when?
That sounds like a problem.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
That's good money.
Then what?
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
What did he do?
What's your relationship?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
You know how she is.
So you're sure she's dead.
Then what?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I'm going out for a few hours.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
How can I help you?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Beaumont Livingston.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
She got off, huh?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
All I did was walk out with it.
That I gotta see.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
No, thanks.
Della?
I could have told you that.
Short? It's ended.
Hello.
Maybe the demons are real.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
I am.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
How do you know?
What are you doing?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I haven't seen her in months.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
What's your name?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
What was that?
I'm not cold.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Jacob, what can I do?
What happened to you?
You up?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
What do you mean you can see?
Is that the one who died?
I don't like things that make you cry.
I'm going home.
Why? What for?
What'd the doctor say?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Don't!
Are you out of your mind?
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Where are they?
What's going on?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Why won't you answer me?
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Sit down, Jake.
Shows how much you knew.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Where's Wong?
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Where am I?
Speaking.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Still married, Jake?
Why the hell we drivin' here?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know. I don't know.
How did it happen?
Do you want me to get someone?
Bring it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
You got lucky.
Yes it does.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Where the hell were you?!!
You see that?
Better let me.
Kay-Em!
Thorgan, suit up.
We'd need charges.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Sergeant!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Rizzo?!
Rizzo, you okay?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
It's time.
Okay?!!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
And what's with the headgear?
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
I'm missing two!
What are you doing?
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
I don't know...sorry?
Kay-em 14.
Who are you apologizing to?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
We're missing two of the kids!
Kicker!
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
But...I...400 years?
What have you done?
My cars. And a comic book.
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
That's it! Radio in for help!
Did you get him in the head?
Have you ever had one do this?
He's comin' up -- !
Probably out in the back yard.
Love ya.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
He lost it on the way up.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Who are you?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
He ate a car?
Look at him take it!
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
He's busy.
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
Transplants?
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
He's heading under -- !
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Okay, cool.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
I don't like Katrina.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Why?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
I try really hard, actually...
Mine too.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
What are you talking about?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
What do you play?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Commercials.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
The Wizard of Gore?
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
What are you?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
You should try Adderall.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
I heard that was you.
Can I take your coats?
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Then what's going on?
Is the baby okay?
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
No way! She's pretty.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
What do you make with that?
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
What did you do?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Looks like it, yeah.
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Walter Livesy.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Where you from Walter?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Dahlia, no.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Carrie.
All set?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What are you going to do?
Nervous?
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Early, just think...
Yes. Altogether.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Yes.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Shit.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Yeah.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah.
Yeah. Why you give money.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Shut up.
Casper, where is he?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Because your a virgin?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
What?
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Do you know where he went?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Four-thirty in the morning?
What are you guys doing?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
No, I need the original note.
He's not talking about himself.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
You still having a problem with this?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Hello, Peter.
Did you know her?
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
I've figured out the message.
Very good.  How did you know?
No problem.  We're in.
I just can't believe it.
I know he really likes you.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
Who told you that?
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
What about prints?
How long she been dead?
What do you think he did?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
But we heard him.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Did you see his face?
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
Did you send the car?
Then I'll transpose.
Whatever's on your mind.
I can check and call you back.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
How come you don't stay with them?
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
You sure you don't want to eat something?
In a way.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know it was bad.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
What is this?
What's wrong?
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
In the Arctic ice.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
Does the Queen live?
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
But you suspect.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
The spiral begins in the west.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
When did you last sleep, boy?
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
You've eaten nothing.
We must try to get horses.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
We could reach it on fire-mares.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
No.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
They'll trample him to death!
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Modred! Impossible!
You know the voice.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
No.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Well, I don't need them...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
130... 140...
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
May I go to the cinema?
No.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
A little...
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Messina.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Where?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Mine.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
You do?
Ellen?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
You like to take walks?
I've changed my mind.
You've just decided, is that right?
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Go to sleep Ellen.
Pacifica, California.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Nine.
What was that?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
What happened?
When are you leaving?
Walking where?
You're walking to California?
Why know?
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Don't do this.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
What's your shoe size?
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Orange soda?
Are you working?
What's up?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
OK.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Your color.
I don't understand any of that.
Thank you, Sera.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
There are limits.
How'd this happen?
About ready for another drink?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
I have a 4.0.
I loved him!
You're fired. I have new representation.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Where you got in the shower.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Sit down.
Thank you.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
Why didn't you call me?
-- his life?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
I'm so happy for you!
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Licensed attorney or family member?
What?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Why?
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
No -- it's just -- not me.
How could this happen?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Neither.
I did?
You're beautiful.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
Harvard. Law school.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
You look -- nice.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
You go?  Not watch fun?
What?
You go to lady now?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
No more... please...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Or looked so beautiful...
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
It's terrible.
No, wait... please... listen...
And if I cannot?
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Whatever for?
Beware.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Sunlight.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Liar!
Sport, indeed.
What's the matter?
They rival the angels of paradise.
Where are you going?
Who?
My father and the Baron.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I thought you were dead... I --
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
I'm promised to another!
Up ahead!
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
Dad's disappeared!
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
Mom said I should.
Oh.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Don't you have school?
Can you keep Sam straight?
You have to ask like that?
What did you think it would be?
Hey.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
What's the point of this?
Does everything have to have a point?
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
He won't leave my room.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I have the permit.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Forty.
Uh huh.
Thanks for the shower.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I can promise you complete privacy.
I'm leaving.
The gloves on the table are for you.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
To hide a black eye.
After everything.
She seemed upset.
I still don't know what that means.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
She needs to be alone, I think.
What are you doing?
But you can't call me while you think?
Why would they tow your truck?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Last time you were gone for a week!
No.  I was going to let you do that.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
Do you remember?
Where's Sam?
You brought your kids?
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I'm married.
Let's not do this, okay?
I need to know.
I could die.
Don't move!
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Nothing.
Don't even...I'm there.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You don't look like you.
You got a dog?
Nagger?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Then what's the problem?
She's alright, isn't she?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
No, man. I want you to have it.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
I'm not working on a plan.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
'Course I was right. About what?
It's too late for plans.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
How about some steak sauce?
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Who?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Valerie's crying!
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Did you just talk?
It's not me, moron.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
So far, so good. Now what?
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Knock, knock.
Now everybody sit down.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Definitely.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
It's Stanley, sir.
What was it called, sir.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Please. You got to.
You smell like coconuts.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Basically, yeah.
What are you doing?
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
It looks like the work of a brother...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
Who invited you?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
No.
And now?
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
Of course.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I don't..
Maybe you'll think of something...
Uh-uh.
I have.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
Hello, Sandman.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
What makes you think so?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
We're leaving.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
I'm, okay... You okay?
Maid? Relative?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Yeah, I remember.
I want more.
Have you partied with him?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Pornos.
Set.
I don't. I don't know him.
You don't look so good.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
No.
Out in back.
What's bothering you, Madison?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
I had a dream about you last night...
Don't you want to watch it?
We will.
Where would you feel safe?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
I told you to stay in the car!
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
The heart, I guess.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
We just killed a couple of people...
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Oh, read it!
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Why, of course. Yes.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Where are they? Do you see them?
Will you stop squawking!
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Say, what about that gold deal?
Huh?
Hey, what's happened to you?
And mine's Conway.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
You have no disputes over women?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
They were.
He amputated his own leg?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Charming, isn't she?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Why, no.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Yes.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Did I say "if"?
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Porters?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
George, come back!
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
You're wrong, George.
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
A man whose life was empty!
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Yes, I know.
I'm thirty.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
Cowan--
It'll make sense later?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
We wear black.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
You don't know the half of it.
Why?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
what's this?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Jesus Christ...
Kay.  All I'm saying--
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not my pals--
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
They went right to the President.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Agatha --
He's here.
I can't.  I have to know.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Someplace safe.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her...
You set your patients on fire!
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
You the only sentry?
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Try again.
Tell me not to worry, John.
Lara called me.
I go running down there.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Red Ball?
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
If it's a question of authority.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
She was looking right at me.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Stop --
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
Some -- somebody's father?
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Kill me!
And how did Lamar become involved?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
You said they're destroyed.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
-- and then walk out.
Who?
I understand.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Lamar, I found something.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
What?
Can't they shut that off?
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
Since right after we lost our son.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you, sir.
So, wait, you're from where?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Max offered to stake me.
Whu --
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
5-5-1.
You driving her?
Get away from her.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
You bet the ponies?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
What?
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Ruiz knows about this?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
We get it. We're sorry.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
I can wait around if you want.
Yeah.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
I'm on the phone.
I'll page you.
I'll page you with the number.
Then why do you try to get in?
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
We don't need guns.
He didn't say we need guns.
Fuck him.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh really. Why's that?
What are you doing?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
I told you what they said.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Back in.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
What the fuck's going on?
He wants to see us now.
Nothing, man.
Let's do it.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Wanna bet?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You're out of money?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You did?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
No more, man.
Let's just go now and wait.
Kinda. Yeah.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Ugh...
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
See you later.
Does anyone want another?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Thanks.
Keys.
What?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
No. I'll take a strega.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
And where might that be?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Man's rep travels.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
Take it easy, baby.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Who the hell are you?
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
What for?
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Do you?
What points?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Let's talk about you for a change.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Because you're in trouble.
Dear heart, I love you.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
You put it very well.
Let him finish.
Can I ask you something?
'Bout every other night, Red.
I ain't stupid.
Let's go.
How long has this been going on?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
What mission?
You're my father.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
That's right.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
What do you want?
So you are going to talk me to death.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[Why?]
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Deal.
[What is his name?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[I believe you.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
I drink.
So how's business?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
What are you doing?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Did you used to?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Where are you?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Last night. Do you know something?
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
You should be sleeping, baby.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I think it's fantastic.
Hmm?
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
You helped him get this job.
I could see she likes you.
Waddaya gonna do now?
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Hey! What are you doing here?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
What happen?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Yes, I know.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Wadda you think?
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Please...
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Sure. This girl said...
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
You not ugly.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
That's all right, that's all right...
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Back home.
Miss you, Walt.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
You got directions?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
What's that?
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
I have a tent to myself.
We think the same way.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
But what about Major Houlihan?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
No, no, that one.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Is he out?
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Ayuh.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I didn't have much choice.
Yes, Reverend?
Thanks.
What's wrong with him?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
About that chest-cutter...
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
What's that, Henry?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
How is he?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Action?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
No.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
All set, Ann?
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
All right, boys, here he is.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Go out and find her!
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What do they want?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
The heelots!
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
St-rike!
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
No!
It must be some kind of a gag.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Sure.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
No.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Is there anything wrong?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
What do you mean, too bad?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
What?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
I hate fucking Springfield.
I what?
What's the suspect's name?
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Are you in charge, Roper?
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
I've rarely shot anyone.
I don't really like to drink.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
I think I can handle that one.
I'm not good at lying.
You know the ten commandments?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
He's cutting down the visibility.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Yeah?
Scottie...
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Any verification on numbers.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
Guests?
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
He had access to the keys --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
What is it?
A hotel?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Then where is she?
You said we were on the same programming team.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Resurrection.
Destination?
Male.
Program name?
We've got him locked!
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Anybody see anything?
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
What's a Triac?
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
SKULL!!
Simon says...
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
I had everything. Once.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Four-twenty-eight.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
I'm already late.
I needed to see you again.
Same here.
It's too late.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
You gotta plan these things.
What are ya thinkin'?
Not stupid. Fat.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
He's an animal!
You get fifteen percent.
Forget it. That's past.
Strategy.
Luciano is dead?
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Switch hands.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Stu Miley.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Why?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Bitchin' good cake.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Hypnos?
How am I gonna get past the guards?
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Where'd he go??
What?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Is there something else I can do for you?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother!
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Mother!
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Really?
He's an organic farmer.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
... Oh ...
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Where's the Majority Leader?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
But it *isn't*?
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Shut up, Diz.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Have *you*?
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
All right, why?
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
I did. What about it?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
Where were you?
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
For a *question*.
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Can't you?
Most natural thing in the world!
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Convene?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
And with your help--
Oh, just a day--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Yes, yes--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Go right ahead.
I also answer to whistles.
Great.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
Ax?
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yes--
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Maybe he won't get up.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
He sure is pixilated.
He's still pixilated.
Yes, sir.
What's that got to do with it?
Tell me more about yourself.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
It's wonderful.
Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
There's Times Square.
Oh, I don't know.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
I've often thought about going back.
He did? I play the tuba—
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Ready?
A girl?
Well, here we are again.
I'm crucifying him.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
You're acting like a school girl.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Sure.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Nuisance value?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Newspaperman?
Look!
How do you do.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Yes.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Why not? Who is he?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Ja.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Mrs. Semple?
A child? My uncle's?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Is she home?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Me, sir?
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Uh-huh. What are they?
Take your time.
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
Why not?
What's that?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Althea hasn't told you?
What do you think's wrong with her?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
You do?
Yeah.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
...And?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Lily.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Got a license?  But no car?
What's wrong with her?
How are you?
Well, look who's here...
Could I see Sofie, please?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Either one.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Yeah?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Mother...
I guess you saw the show...?
You feel violated?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Weekly or monthly?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What'd he say?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Hey, Skip.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Damn! What is your name?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Sounds like you have several.
But look at me now...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
What about it?
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Psych major?
English Lit.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
The sun turning black.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Twenty.
No?
You swear?
You know your history.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
Can you swim?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I'm not?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Got guts, lady.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
You did not!?... We're not!?
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Really?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Come on, baby!
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
It's me... Elizabeth.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Alone tonight?
Date?
Why?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
At the Frankenstein Center.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
You're the Sphinx.
My heart died a long time ago.
Oh don't start that again --
Have you ever seen him?
There's just not enough of us.
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Firepower costs money.
We're superheroes.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
It's on the television.
I always knew that you were special.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Definitely.
To us!
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Ah -- you approve?
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
But who made this treaty?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Ah-hh, no.
It is the work of incendiaries.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Oh...?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Were you in love with him?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Will you be joining us, soon?
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
I know.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
No.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Naw, it ain't like that.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Where you going?
You know what he mean, dude.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Man, this a cool house.
You straight?
Just a little.
What?
You know what this is?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
It's alright.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
And some rolling papers.
Thanks for the help.
I know.  I'm sorry.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
I'll take you later.
Nothing.  What you want?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Elroy.
What?
You were very nervous.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
For not believing you.
This says "invitation only".
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
I kill her - and you kill me.
You know what I'm gonna do.
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
All right. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I said I have to do something.
Please. Something is going to happen...
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
You're going to go see her.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
I'm not a baby.
Yeah.
Any trouble?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Here they come.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
She went.
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Bluebeard!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
Tricked us!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Pearl dotes on him.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What could have possessed that girl!
How?
John! Don't!
John?
I'll see to Pearl.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
All right boy: where's the money?
What?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Our honeymoon.
I -- no, I --
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
You'll whip me!
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Miz Cooper!
What?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Guess I did.
Haven't slept, have you?
Uh-oh...
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
You used me, daddy!
Dad -- what you doing here?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Who? Who did that?
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
School.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Bring me forty-five back.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
I see.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
What was it like?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
We had to take it on account of the safe.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Good evening, Gaston.
Have you?
Yes, General Savitzky?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Let's do that.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I must get into that country of yours!
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
No.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
So that is your house?
He takes good care of that.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ni-notchka.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
It's twelve o'clock.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Why?
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
On which boat?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Probably not.
I have never heard one.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
A funny story?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No music.
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
No.
Make it ice cold.
You haven't seen her yet?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
No thanks, Swana.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
She's gone, Leon.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Where are they?
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Good morning, Comrade.
Yes, it does.
I don't understand.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Raw carrots and beets.
The future of the common people.
Where to, madame?
At Père Mathieu's.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
We'll see about that ...
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
I'll bet he would.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
No, you didn't, Bob.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
What about England?
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
Can we get around this, Al?
That's right ...
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
But what are we paying him for?
Just do what I say, Bob.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Jesus!
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
What'd you say?
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
What?
Mr. Castro.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Oh, my goodness ...
How about you?  Are you going to win?
I never met the man.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
How the fuck did you know?
Who we working for?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
No, Henry.  I don't.
... as the old alliances crumble.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Did you cry when he died?
Yes.
Why?
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... give me a break, Mary.
But it was all we had.
Syracuse.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Yes, yes.
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I want a divorce.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Dick, you should call Bobby.
He looked old, didn't he?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
You personally?
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
That man that shot you died in prison.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
How come're you doin that?
I'm... discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
None of that explains your man though.
Oh yes.
No I ain't.
Some pretty bad people.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Well. Old age flattens a man.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yessir.
Yessir.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
Uh-huh.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
What should I do?
Why would I let you do that?
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
Not a bleep.
You know she won't be there.
With what?
You already asked me that.
Sir?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
...Where you want me to put it?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
It's all right.
November the 28th, last year.
Yessir.
Yes?
The what?
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
How would you describe him?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Sugar?
Took me about three hours.
Pot metal?
I don't know.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
I got an overcoat on.
Are you in the service?
...I meant your food.
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
You should get the order you want.
...plenty
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
Little place called "Williams," why?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Do you know who I am?
I am?
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Yes, ma'am.
Umm... yes. Back home.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
I don't know.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Did you love it?
I left my husband two days ago.
Like Rome?
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Were you with him this whole time?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
I... I don't know...
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
What 'look'?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
We can live with that.
Should I kill him now?
What the hell was that, another statement?
Where? Where is she?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
This is Betty at twelve.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Really?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I'll think about it.
Hmm?
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Waitaminute -
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Gopher, Everett?
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
What's his name again?
Them straw polls is ugly.
Suckin' away.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
That's not my ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
A million dollars.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It was a moment a weakness!
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
It's bona fide!
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
Hi, Byron.
Yeah, I know.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
I want to fly, sir!
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Pardon?
No, sir.
What other issue is there, Sid?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
No. I never feel like that.
God help you, Lynette!
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
You got a girl?
Do you go to school?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I vote for the motel.
Twenty-two years ago.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
No problem.
He said open it.
I have the gun.
What?  What do you want me to do?
You got an idea?
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
Fuck!
Who is this guy?
Yeah?
We'd like to come in.
You don't look so good.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
Ever read any Poe?
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
Don't.
What do they want?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Say fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Blue is phones?
He'll do something.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
You know it. Stay Black...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Can you make a deal with them?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You alright?
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
I expect to try.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Excuse me?
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
I consider them linked.
Very well, let us move on to...
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Father...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Cheraw Falls.
Where?
Balderdash!
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
How far away?
Don't worry.
But father, they might come this way.
Honey, Church will be fine.
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Yeah, sure.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Hey--they actually found the place!
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
I can hardly read these.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
But--
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Can I have another one?
Why, then, things should be fine.
Rachel not feeling well?
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I just said--
Getting there.
I heard you tonight.
You better get going, hon.
She.  Goes.  Free.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Thank you, sir.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Miss Swann.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
What?  He never told me that.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
We had time to get to know each other.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
It's still against the law.
Is that so?
That's not true.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
It will be an ascension.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Sir, please try to hold still.
The big house?
Yeah, we'll see.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
What happened to it?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
What's wrong?
Where is it?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Yes.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Don't mind Mother.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
No? What do you look upon her as?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Anne, come here. Listen—
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Your house?
Ah-ah-ah!
Huh?
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Yeah?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah?
Gloria Golden?
Come on, get going, get going!
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
What play?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Right.
What other girl—?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
I don't eat waffles.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Stop calling me Mother!
Yes - the worm!
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
No, sir.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
Can I ask you a question?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
No. I want to know.
... Sex.
You sure you want to know this?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Where'd you get this?
She's crying.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
What?
But where would we go?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
It's six-thirty ...
But it could happen.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Oh sure it is.
What do you mean!?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Lemme see that.
What did you do?
Play along?
As a matter of fact he does.
No way.
It's in your closet.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Scout?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Hello there.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
BUD.
What do you mean?
Why?
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Yes.
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Really?
What happened?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
What city?
What's the listing?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
No.
Yeah I can't.
Why?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
What's all this pudding?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Hello, this is Back.
Where are you?
Do you like porno movies?
Are your pants off?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Not very late.
You're going to work now?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I have to go.
I don't know.
There's a piano in the street.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Really?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Ok.
Alright?
....Hi.....
No, no. I did.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Nothing.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
It's so nice.
For work.....
That's right you travel so much.
Are you ok?
You can't do that.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
On my knife.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I know.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
Barry Egan.
-- and this is confidential?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
How's business?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
You ok?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
No thanks.
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
Where you goin?
Please don't do this.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
You can't just stay in your house.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
So they'll go.
Just tell him to call me.
Ok.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Once or twice.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
You mean to take us all down with you?
You always do.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
His rug.
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Who's to say I did not?
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Don't start --
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
-- words alone are insufficient.
And I in yours.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Leave at once --
Very much.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Not you too
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
So I've been told.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
How much?
It's not really--
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
There's nothing to explain
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I will not have this in my home.
Yes?
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
We're using-
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Forget it-
Magic
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Jesus
This better be good
Yes.
He'll destroy us.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
I'm sorry.
Did I ever tell you about my father?
Hey, kid. Gregg.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
May I help you?
It came.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
CITIZEN KANE
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
What's up, Colonel?
What who's been sayin'?
Believe what you want.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
You want me to do what?
Jack, I got no gloves.
How do you know? You know her that good?
Huh?
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
You want us to wait for you?
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
See? That's all there was to it.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Screw you, Jack.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Yeah.
Huh?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
What'd you see?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
I said, let's go.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
And you're drinking with them right now.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Name me a better photographer.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
She never left the apartment --
If possible -- both.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Read some good books.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
It's me.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Got a shovel?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Ten here.
Yes.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
That's good news.
Yes.
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Homework. It's more interesting.
Lisa, please!
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
But you're not?
Well?
Wasn't that close?
How?
L. B. Jefferies.
Nobody chickened.
Feel okay?
You satisfied or you want more?
What's he going to pull--
Tell him why we moved here.
You can't protect me.
Yeah!
That's funny!
What would you do, Dad?
Well, now--
You're absolutely right!
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Will you wait a minute?
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
What's that pounding?
He's home.  I heard the car.
Frank!
I'll wait for him.
Hi.
I just don't want trouble.
Who has?
Who's that!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Man, you're schizoid!
No.  At dawn.
Here.
Can I keep it?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Plato!
Wash up and go home.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Leave me alone.
Chicken?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
"Life is crushing in on me."
Won't mother be proud.
The kids take me.
No.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Yes.  My best friend.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
What?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
No.  Why?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Why?
Gabriel -- !
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
What are you doing here?!
You promised me!
Searching for a money man...
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Gabriel!
You can't find... what?
Toys for... adults?
Negative five?
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Nick --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Nick, I love you --
Nick died for me....
What?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
I'm almost done.
No.
What?
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
You got one hour.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
No gun.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How long ago was your makeover?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Merlin, I didn't know --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Hell you haven't.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Not yet.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
What, working security?
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Rudy, don't move --
Ash... Ashley...
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
There is no other table --
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
We can work this out, can't we?
Bullshit.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Did the two of you talk?
What about?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
What do you care?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
You didn't ask.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Joe.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
You really think we were set up?
Want a smoke?
How can you be so sure?
Where? Are they out in the car?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
I think he's just passed out.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
This must have been in the family a long time.
Where do you keep the can opener?
They're stragglin'.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
The who?
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Go on. Tell me more about her.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Which ranch?
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
At the ranch maybe?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
That's right, Steve.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
How's that?
I can't take her with me.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Goodbye and thanks.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
She was only teasin'.
Oh, sure.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Alex, what are you doing?
Hey, Brenda.
My favorite memory was when we --
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Thanks.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
He's right. I should go first.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Buddy...
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Where the hell are we?
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, let me...
I know, but I've been thinking --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Okay, I get the point.
But he'll kill her!
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Stop touching his brain!
It was you...
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Am I cool now?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
I finished all the interviews.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Professor, I think you should see this.
The image there.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Would you like to see the girl?
Father, are you okay?
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Yes.
Father, I think you should rest.
This part removes the sense of humor.
It says, "Ray."
Get out?! What does it say?
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
BLOOD FEAST!
Did you hear?
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
Hi!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
But Mom, the video's not over.
Oh Mom...
Detectives, what is this about?
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Don't I get a kiss?
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
I beg your pardon?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
And who may I ask is Carl?
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
He's a good boy.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
You think my sister is there?
Yes, I understand.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
When I wanted to.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
How much does she want?
How's Miss Jacqueline?
I can't understand it at all.
But I like teaching school.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I ought to know.
Nothing.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I understand.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
What was she to you?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me what?
I think it's time.
What?
Dr. Judd?
Cloven hoof?
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
I don't believe it.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Oh, uh-huh.
No, I think you look... fine.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
You mean like "time flies"?
Why'd you drop out?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
What?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
My therapist said that --
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
What are these?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
All of these are interviews?
About sex?
And they just answer them?
To you?
She said it on her tape.
Don't you want to make one?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
It won't. Are you ready?
Is he going to see this?
Who was the last person you had sex with?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
And now you can?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
I want out of this marriage.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
God, no.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
But he won't.
Because I never got around to it.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
I wanted him to see me.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
There's a phone here.
Do I know you?
You want me to leave?
She still is.
How did you find me?
Not exactly.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
How do we start?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Then what happened?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Cynthia, I don't know.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
You're intrigued?
Hello.
Cynthia. John.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
It'll just be me.
Yes?
Is that the man who called you up here?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
What?
You got it!
SIN-I-FUL
We're the experts.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
He was a President.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I don't want to get up there.
I'm not going, Janet.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Oh my poor baby.
It's...
YOUNG BLOOD
No!  He's never done that before.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
So what's up?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
What do you think?
How's it hanging, Miles?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
I'd rather have a knife.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
When do we get to drink it?
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
So you're going to stop acting?
Sure I know Maya.
Have you no shame?
So what's the plan today?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
I want to go home now.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
What?
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Count me out.
What?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
That was three years ago after that first party!
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Is it the money thing?
What's happening?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
What?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You know what I'm thinking?
So what's the plan?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
I'm fine. You rest.
What's wrong?
You broke some.
Maya, how are you?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Twelve months in oak.
Hi.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
So what's your novel about?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Okay.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
But you wanted to fuck me first.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
So what's happening with your book?
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
I'm pregnant.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
It was a surprise, Mom.
What's the matter?
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
I cursed.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Morgan, be careful.
Yes.
This is going to do nothing.
Have they said anything about our area?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
What's two?
I don't think so.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Why not?
Is that him?
Don't do it!
I think we lost 'em.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Paden sends his best.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
My name is Emmett.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
I haven't done anything.
Jefferson City?
South of here, past Chimayo.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
You own this land.
That's a lie.
What's that?
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
This a friend of yours?
All I did was kiss the girl.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Why him?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
You got a place to stay?
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
I'm going to have to look into this.
What's she got to do with it?
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
So-called?
Who's the owner?
Where's the dog now?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
How about you?
I've got a place I can hide her.
Of course.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Almost right.
Why not?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
How about the nudity?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Clyde.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
-- Please, get away from me.
Good for you, Hank.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
I don't know anything about computers.
You saw that?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I do okay.  How about you?
She thinks you're with Simone.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
But that's Simone's part.
Hi.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
You mean they buy it?
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
Don't step in the horse manure.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
I'm going to see you again, right?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What?
I didn't know you were funny.
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
I don't know, Cole.
Yes, I am.
They're right here.
Communicate?
Where is she?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
She wanted me to tell you--
Cole, please stop.
S-ssssstop it!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Alright!
What's a "little while?"
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Bitch.
I happen to be a professional.
Hi.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Suzie???
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Carl, what are you doing?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
You're out of your mind, man.
Are you crazy?
So... what does it do?
He means moon shining.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Sure. What do you want to know.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Is that right?
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Then why go back now?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
No Mac, please... I --
...no... Mac... p-please...
Carl.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Shit.
How are you going to find him?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
What you up to?
Pretty, ain't they?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Where are you?!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Shelby --
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Welcome home.
Okay.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
An existentialist.
I give up.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Yeah?
What are you thinking?
No.
Also boring.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Go breaker.
That's the point, Dickey.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
Is your security team armed?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I left him a message.
-- You can and you will.
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Wow.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
Like a mafucka.
What's wrong?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
You'll end up like me.
No, she won't.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
They come when you sleep.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What do you want?
Her oxygen would have run out.
Don't.
Not a very happy poem.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
Then it's God, right?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
What's wrong.
You're the coward.
Do you?
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Neither did I.
Chris --
How can you be here...
He won't do it.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Looks a little constipated to me.
Beg pardon?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I'll come with you.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
You could do better.
What do you want?
I do care about you!
Pretty bad.
Everyone's all right...?
I like your coat.
Keep what handy?
Your what...?
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Okay?
Coming to bed?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What're you talking about --
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
What about Tommy?
You in this with me?
Wasn't your fault.
Yes.
Why should she come in?
Let my kid go.
Nice threads Dad.
Okay, I guess.
Mom and I got plans.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
What, want a glass?
You stop him?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Remember Little League?
Lizzy!
Harry…
Yeah--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
What's this? A cockaroach?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Huh?
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
I... I like you.  A lot.
Waldos.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
I'm a photographer, remember?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
A match made in heaven.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I will finish what I've begun…
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Mr. Parker.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
I asked if you felt like a drink--
You're sure you're all right.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Jawohl!
Coming up.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Come again?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Sefton!
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I'm okay here. Why bother?
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
Interesting.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl.
Stop it, Harry!
Let me go!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
No, Animal.
No?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
She'll never forgive me!
What do those broads say?
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Not yet.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Says who?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
Right.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
I'll kill you for that!
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Ich weiss alles.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
It's working.
Target their Bridge.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Close to retirement?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
What's normal?
No.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Sir?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Understood. That will be all.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Doctor Soran?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
Trilithium?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Aye, sir.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Response?
Locate.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
I don't believe it...
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
.          .. Spock's tube...
Not exactly.
Did your collaborator know?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
I'll go...
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Count on our help, sir.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
No.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
What about Spock?
Share this with no one.
I ordered no interruptions.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Sir, may I --
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
You're not going in there -- !
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Wait --
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Does that about do it?
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Jim --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
It was just words.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
They're still running with shields down.
Thirty seconds...
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Admiral --
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Is the word given?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Carol Marcus --
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Aye sir --
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Because... there was no way to win.
On screen...
Indeterminate life signs.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
I do this because I was there,
How're you doing?
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
It doesn't look all that different.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
That is what I said, Doctor.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Fundoscopic examination --
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Can you isolate the wave?
Damage report!
Find it?
Like what?
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Can you protect us?
I suppose they told you that...?
You mean man...
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Or believe, I'll bet.
Do you trust me?
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
It's true... what you said...
In progress, Admiral.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
I meant --
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Aye, sir. Descending.
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
... Yes?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
But not you.
Don't you ever get tired?
Do machines ever play?
For what purpose?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
No one's ever asked me that before.
No... I want to stay with you...
And our people?
Very funny...
From the mission...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
That's your expert opinion?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Who is it?
Deck five.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Worf to Picard...
Scanners are off line!
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Augh?
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
You actually performed surgery...?
Not yet.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
What year is it?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Captain, the Enterprise!
Yes.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Track their weapons fire.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're bypassing Engineering...
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Uh, Jim...
I didn't mean this future.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
This is fun...
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Stand...?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields. Battle stations.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
But I am not human. I am only -
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Faith...?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
A computer canna lie, sir.
I think  not.
This one can.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Can you remember our father?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Brother. I cannot move.
Because you are dangerous.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole’ me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don’t show up for my physical on time!
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
You have a red shirt.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
If you wouldn't mind.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
No.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Just lucky, Admiral.
That will never happen.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
But she's not the Enterprise.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Yes.
After you, Praetor.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
You know that's not possible.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
So they’ve got him up and running.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
And?
But surely...
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
For the moment.
How much are your rooms?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Make any money?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
You're not hearing me.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
Mrs. Haydn...
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Which way?
What?
What?
No gas.
No gas.
Shit?
Horses.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
Then let me go. You don't need me.
A baby is a new person?
Do you have a baby?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
Jennyhaydn.
Yes.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
You liked my singing?
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You promised.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
You get that, Lyman?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
You married, Major?
I don't understand.
Is there a reward in this?
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Hello...
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Jesus.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Damn right.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
What?  Right Here?
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
That's not sayin' much.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
What?
Who was just here?
What clip?  What was it?
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
So that gives you something.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I'm not going.
I guess.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Was this him?
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
This isn't in our database?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
I have 6 tons.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Jesus.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
Yes.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
What?
How do you feel, Agent
I'll take it into consideration.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
"Was?"
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
I was visiting an old college friend.
There was talk of a file photo.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Thanks for the ride.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
I know.
The tattoo?
Hello?
What's up?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
You were right. He found me.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Zero killed them all?
Who told you about her?
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Murman!
Shit.
You have to put things in perspective.
It didn't feel that way.
...maybe...
Nikki.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Oh. You know.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Hi.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Oh my God.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
It's a rebound.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah?
I heard you might be moving back...
Right.
Well that sucks.
It's a gig.
It's definitely a step back for me.
What do you want? You're tall.
I didn't mention her once today.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Darwinism at its best.
I just tested for one...
There are so many beautiful women here.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
I'm such an asshole.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
She was cute.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
What Vegas?
I'm not going to Vegas.
Wait.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Cut that shit out.
That's not cool.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
I know, but...
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
What?
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
No, baby. You're money.
Michelle went for you, right.
Selling scrap metal.
You guys are such assholes.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
A day.
Tomorrow?
That was pretty cold, dude.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
It is on.
And you?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Good.  He never doubted you.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
The Court gave you justice.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Be my friend.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
You heard about your father?
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Good for ten men...
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
But you needed a drink first.
For bravery.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
Mike!  The party starting!
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Was there a definite proposal?
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
I've never seen anything like it.
Who is he?
You like spaghetti?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
Michael?
I don't think so either.  I better go.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
How's Mom?
I can help you out...
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
A million times.
And all his works?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
I love jazz.
Good afternoon!
You're breaking my ribs!
I know. I write like a child.
No!
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
What?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
I guess.
What about Christmas?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Did he kill Freddie?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
I told you! I knew it!
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Is this you?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Randall.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Dickie, my God!
Of course. Aunt Joan.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Does he stay with you here?
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
Thank you.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Why?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
What?
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
What about the record?
Keep it.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
More people watch it.
No, why?
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
Oh, are you all right?
You sure he's not Italian?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
I don't like my real name.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Well, I tried.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Who's a killer?
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
No.
You want to work uptown nights?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
What's the action around?
Wiz?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Limp dick?
I'll go.
Partners?
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Now, did you remember that, or...
I see...
Yes... yes, I do.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I do.
I... I need a drink of water.
Here we are.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Dad, I...
Luke... what time is it?
Did I what?
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Sandra Sinclair.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Jesus.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Huh?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
You can't testify.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
I taught you that.
What?
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
It's about me.
That you got let go.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
I was wondering...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
How'd you happen to come here?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Is smoking fun?
Lois!
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Thank you.
Daniels.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Whose side are you on?
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I know, Mother.
Maybe we ought to leave.
When?
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Mitch...
But they'll be back.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
The sign says strawberry finches.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
I don't know you.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Oh, no you don't!
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
Can't see a thing.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
What did it say?
I told you what happened in Rome!
But not for me.
What do you want ?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Last night? What do you mean?
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Hear, hear!
It was like that yesterday.
Melanie...
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
The power.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
You said three o'clock.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Have you got a pencil?
What were the crows after at the school?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I'm not sure, but...
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
Of course.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
Aye.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
I don't think I can go on, sir.
Gray killed her.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
This is not a woman!
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
I would make you rich.
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
I come from Lisbon.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
I'm looking for my friends.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Think maybe knives do?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
How do you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Yeah, we do.
You know.
They botched the execution.
Fucking crow.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You mean Alex.
It still doesn't mean...
He'll be there at 8:30.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I leave that in your hands.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
Did you have a nice day, dear?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Go to the movies.
We certainly did.
How does he explain that?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I feel different right now.
Yes--?
Who?
I was.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
He's my brother.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
They're looking at us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Two down and two to go.
Whattaya mean?
What's going' on?
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
... And stay outta here.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Still mad at me?
Michael, are you still in bed?
No.  I'm up.
I'm tired now.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Are you following me?
Star.
What do you mean?
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
You're beautiful.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Mom's home?...
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Maybe dinner.
Where these tracks headed?
Anybody sick?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Now why'd you go and...
What?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Let go of me...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch it over there!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Torch them!!
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Don't let up, Childs!
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
He's one of them.
Now how did you get hurt?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
This is it?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Do you know where they live?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Machines?
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Say I just come back again?
Why?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
I don't think that's going to happen.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
No... let's walk through the city.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Let them.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Do you know you were humming?
What?
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
That's absurd --
This... was my home.
His curiosity is amazing.
Is he all right?
We all have that dream.
This is magnificent...
What's it all for?
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Learning was important?
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Yes.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Go back to your own time?
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
No, sir --
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
I am the oldest.
We choose to believe it.
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
And you've no idea where he went?
Sir?
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
We are not birds of a feather.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
And what's that?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
How?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
No, it hasn't.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
I think I can remember what's on them.
I gave you my dog tags.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
How long do we have?
I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
Then, where are you going?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
I don't understand.
You were convicted of the crime.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Why not?
I wasn't talking about anything.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Well, where are you from?
Well, how'd you get here?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Who do you think did it?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Armed robber.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
What did ya do?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Can't it go to any office?
Peaches.
Hey, peaches.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Why now, Jimmy?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Front.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
How come he let you go?
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Get the car.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I wish we could've brought him with us.
What did Darryl say?
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Drive!  Drive away!
You're disturbed.
Louise?  Where are we?
You mean now or before?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Harlan.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Yeah, you want it?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
What do you mean?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can live in a hacienda.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
What?!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
Louise!
So you admit it?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
I'm asking you to leave.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
No You mean...?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Check.
Who?
Nineteen months I been sober.
Am I?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Who the fuck is it to you?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
By the way, what's your name?
A surprise?
A fucking moron.
I guess.
Fuck!!
Urrggghh...
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Oh my.
What are you doing?
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
What's that supposed to mean?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Really? I never got a message.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
You look great.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Get out.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Go!
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I wasn't trying --
Well, there's only one thing to do.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
That is correct.
John. How much time?
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
I don't like what's happening.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Rug samples.
I see.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
What'd she say?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
She's that subtle?
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
What are you --
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
He said he doesn't know.
So what?
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
What do you mean?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Sorry.
Jesus. Oil?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
Go ahead, Ray.
I read, Cooch.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Do you want a coffee?
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
I can't.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Harmless!
How about anything, anything you want to do.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
You're totally insane.
Danger?
What?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
I sit. I think. I play games.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
How does it go?
That's three.
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Yes sir.
Sir?
Can't shake him.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
This is crazy!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Yawing right.
No! Not again!
You're not supposed to...
What do you want?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
Did what?
Tom Kazansky.
Great move. Great
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Time to go.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
What'd you do?
A plaque?
No, we...got our butts kicked.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
Figured out what?
I think I can work it out on my own.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
How do you feel?
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Or....
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
I'm nothing like him.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Welcome to Mars.
So, where to?
Need a ride?
Who are you?
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Eight years.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Are you saying she liked it?
Mmmm.....
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Let me go!
...You mean it?
Just think about it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Right.  Mars.
No options.
I love you.
Forget I said wife.
Why would I lie to you?
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
No problem.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
What the hell you doing back already?
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
You didn't cook breakfast?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
So long, cactus!
You're full of shit.
Oh, Jesus!!
Fuck you!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Its tires are flat...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
And I appreciate it.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Yeah, geography.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Ms. Vin's sister.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
You can't remember that -- !
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
I feel much better now.
A fucking wheelchair?
...What do you mean?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Want to tell me what went down here?
I killed the motherfucker.
Afraid of what?
-- How could I help you?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
In those days, they often worked as a team.
I don't think I know that name.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
You getting this?
-- Every word.
For control of the prison drug trade?
The phone company was broken up.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Blonde.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
Get lost Bobby.
Bobby's got it.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Did she have someone with her?
Was there an argument?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Anything else?
And neither will I.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Did she ever mention any friends?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
I see. He does talk loud.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
What is it?
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
You want a muffin?
The pages are gone. That's real.
Hey, Jacques...
Right on time, baby.
James...
It does matter. We're in love.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
What about tonight?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
What?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Leland, what are you doing?
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
It looks that way.
Yes.
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
I'm on the staff of...
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
What is this going to cost?
It's all right, Mickey.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Yes.
Yes.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Thank you for seeing me.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Exception!
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Is it over?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Hello, I'm calling from...
No.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
And ask me what?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
...hey, I don't need your charity...
I'm going to help her.
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
...I have to stand up for her...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
No.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
What happened, Joey...?
The Doctors.
The broad has disappeared...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Did it do you any good?
I didn't know how to stop you...!
How does it happen cars are running?
Can you handle one of these?
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
We will, sir!
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
He's very excited about it.
The nightmares.
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Yes.
No.
Diabetes?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
Your bed?
Why does God let there be bad things?
You okay?
I'm fine.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
Holy...
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Heather, what is it?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
Coffee'd be nice.
You sound so sure.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
I didn't know sir.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Why'd you do it?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Passport?
How ya doing?
Who?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Immortality.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
No.
What?
What are you blubbering about?
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
No.
I understand.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Used to.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
No sir...
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Hasta siempre.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
That don't seem fair.
Hell, peanut...
...are followin' him around.
What's that?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
You mean like pedal pushers?
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
I do.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who knows, baby?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Yeah.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
How much we got left, honey?
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
What's that?
You think she's gonna make it?
And no AC.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
You been drinkin', huh?
Oughta make 'em happy.
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
LULA!!!!
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Got any plans?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Yes.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Get rid of him?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Through the forehead?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
What?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
By who?
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
That was good.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
So sensitive.
Such as.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
I'll be... somewhere else.
No. There's no one here.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
You're in Kinship?
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
Really? That's remarkable.
Is that really it?
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
But... ?
Professor Tripp?
How's that?
But James. I mean... How long?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Outside Scranton.
I never heard of it.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
How can you tell?
Maybe she didn't come here.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
Because of my coat?
I didn't mean it that way.
I'm not going, with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Do?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Hey.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
New?
Well...
Pow.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Are you sure you parked it there?
He told me.
The more the merrier.
Who's he barking at now?
James is... I don't know...
He's writing his name in water.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
Yo, Traxler.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
A jockey? You mean, like --
I might have his number on campus.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
When can I see her?
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
It wasn't like that.
What's happening?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
I'd love to hear it.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Do you come here often?
I'm not pretty.
I think you do.
I haven't broken any laws.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
So. How are you adjusting?
And your new apartment?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?
Yes?
I said the job is okay.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Ev-i-dence.
No fucking way.
You don't like coming here, do you?
It's okay.
How do you feel about that?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldn't say.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
But roughly, how old?
Are you okay?
I'm all right.
Very weird.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You're quiet at work.
You never spoke to me before.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
You must hate it.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
I get that impression.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
Hey, I'm not --
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
I've changed.
What?
Who doesn't?
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I haven't worn mine in months.
What happened?
Fine.  Be that way.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
I think it likes you.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
That's Perry.
Is that it?  Is this right?
He's convulsing!
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Uh, oh...
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Which one shall I wear?
This one is gorgeous.
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Somebody must live here!
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Find anything?
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Then why do you say them?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
To do what?
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Please, you come too...
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
And what are we going to do now?
Giulia...
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
No, not like this one.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
No.
I can't say.
Who told you this?
Who?
Yes Mother.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
I burnt them.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
Yes, Mother.
Uh huh.
Often?
Where do you meet?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I got sicker.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Then let's talk about something else...
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
Where did you go?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
How did she know that?
Agnes...
I could never be a mother.
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Not my fault.
What the child?
Why?
No I'm not.
Doctor Livingston.
I'm frightened.
Of what?
Of telling you.
Why?
I ate.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
What do you do?
I don't know which one 
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
Frightened.
No...
Not your fault...
It was alive wasn't it?
I put her to sleep.
Marty, what are you doing here?
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
The one up on the third floor?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Two packs a day.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
And what happened?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I am...
When was that?
Sister Paul?
An unhappy woman...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
No, it reminds me.
Long, thin and filtered.
Hand rolled.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
For the Church?
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
I'm concerned about her health.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Hasn't she had enough?
Too late for what?
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
I left it with her and I went for help.
She can't remember.
Lay them down.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Eight and two thirds.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah.
How about Ding Dong?
Shurrup!
You don't think...
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
We're nearly there, sir.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
It's Paul's grandfather.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Aye, I knew you were.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why selfish?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
You can learn from books.
What?
Me!
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Hello.
And we're looking after him, are we?
Anything to spare?
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
You've got a midnight matinee.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
I'm not, no.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
I would have said so.
He's betrayed the class.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Nerves.
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Is that you, Roby?
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
This is Chaz.
Are you okay in there?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Hey, guess what?
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Boy, that's terrific.
Now we're in for it.
How's Broussard?
It will be.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Oh no.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
Don't count on it.
This should do it.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
That way.
How far?
<u>What is it</u>?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
It's stopped?
I thought I'd find you here.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
They're getting pretty close now.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
No... don't...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
Seal everything now!
How many of them are there?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
It's too late!
Deal.
Listen to what?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Hold it, hold it...
Is it still moving?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Okay, I'm out of here!
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
'Bout five minutes.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Eddie...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Just like it.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You have no right to say such things!
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
I never intended you to be.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
Then say so.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
We have that in common.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Bill...
Right here. A minute ago.
Thank you so much.
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
That I am...
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
That never stopped you before.
Twenty minutes!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
For instance what?
- guilty.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
What's all over?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
The kid. Junior.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Okay. Mix.
What a body, what a voice.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Now don't get carried away-
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
What would you like? Texas?
Yes, dear.
Why you have to go out there.
Also Addison deWitt.
Is that what you want me to be?
You're quite a girl.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
Now you want an argument.
Like an agent with one client.
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Late for what?
That's all.
What for?
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
He can help you.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
How'd hear about it?
Right here.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Hi.  Hello, darling-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Three or four miles...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Lloyd, be careful...
Eve.
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
What's so funny?
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Yes, sir.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I just played it.
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Are you breaking the contract?
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
Who'd you vote for?
Go on, go on--
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
How do you want to handle Sloan?
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--shit--
--shit, who do we know?--
--has he got an ax?--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
He'll give us a sworn statement.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
--Howard Hunt?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
I think.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
Who were they?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
--this'll only take one second--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Go on.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Howard Hunt here.
Where?
I think so.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Who's Colson, Harry?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
What else have you got?
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Go on.
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, it was good.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
What are we gonna hear?
You don't like it?
I wasn't making fun of you.
How did you know I was here?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
I don't get it, that really works?
You're so big!
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
You can send me the address too.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Okay.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
I told you.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
No...you...go...ahead.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Vicky, wait.
I think "shithead" really says it.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Like how?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
You sure you're comfortable?
I want to hear you say it.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Ready for what?
Then she said -- she loves me.
I'm such a loser.
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Also like sex with my wife.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
What?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
What about your glasses?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
What the fuck!? You too!?
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
Whoa...
Oh God. Shit...
You on drugs? Huh?
Oh shit... No...
What?
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Because Gaston was after it.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
How well did, er, do you know him?
Enough. Cut him loose.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Are you running away?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Why do you want to go to Paris?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Dmitri?
Don't you, child?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
So where will you go?
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Who's on television?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
We've been through this.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Oh!
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Alvy, I...
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
So sorry.
Oh, you do?
Oh, right.
Yeah, I know.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh, yeah.
Duane?
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Good? I was-
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
M'hm.
You see, like you and I...
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
You- Do you love me?
I know you've only known me a short while.
Don't you think I do?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
You don't want me to live with you?
Mine.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Who cares? Who cares?
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Sinatra?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Yeah, where is the spider?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
I don't know.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
What... huh?
What thing?
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Yeah.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Oh, you got a headache!
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Yeah.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Ah.
Forget it, Max.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
But she's colored.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
M'mmm.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Yeah.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Didn't I say?
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Take good care of it.
Anymore.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Just did.  Jealous?
Escape hatch.
Harry called.
But she's alright.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
And you know our friends, how?
There's a test, you know.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Take your time, Jer.
Ryan's novel.
No luck.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
You want me to uninvite her?
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Not properly watered.
Otis!!!!
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
You're not ready.
I know.
Will you make love with me?
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Ours.
What?
Elitism?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And you know, he really does not.
I need to leave you now.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
What am I, five?
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Lemon.
I think he's really angry with me too.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
How's he doing?
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Really??
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Are you asking me to marry you?
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Why not?
Yes.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
I don't mind...
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
And here they are!
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
What do you mean, thank God?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Really?
You -- you think I'm right?
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Z!  Over here!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Oh, no, sir!
Good.  You're a good soldier.
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Yes, what else?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
...I should?
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Why?
No.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
How is your cold?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
How come?
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
The mirror -- it's broken.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
Here. How about some breakfast?
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
I would.
In this house, you're supposed to.
No -- just come as you are.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Would you mind repeating the question?
That's right, Baxter.
Who?
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
How do you work it with the key?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
You know how people talk.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Yeah --
Naturally.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
What's her name?
Any of that coffee left?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Well, I have things to do --
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Who?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
It's been hell.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
We talked about a lot of things.
That's enough, Fran.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Atlantic City?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Where does she live?
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Dreadful.
What !
You're out of your skull --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Get out --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
None.
Rangers, eh?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Fat. That's real fat.
How long were you up there ?
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Yes, sir --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
What do you see?
How much is left?
And the grass?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Get in there !
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Listen.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
You didn't like him.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Well, he's killing now.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
You smell that.  You smell that?
Wh -- what?
What's the furthest you been in?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
Do you know me?
I think think a lie stinks.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What are you doing?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Sure.
Why?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
That's 27, sir.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
34   CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
95   CONTINUED:
119  CONTINUED:  
...I won't let a killer walk!
39   CONTINUED:
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
I don't want to talk any more.
What are you doing?
Did you catch Corbett?
-- Permanently?
Let's go.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Leave it here.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Stay put!
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
You know Meyerling?
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
Yeah?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What are you talking about?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
How was it talking to him?
Do you love me?
Yes.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
No.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Okay.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
My son.
And?
Fries.
Were you asleep?
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
What?
How you doing, great one?
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Which color was that?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Please, just leave.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Picking on me won't help.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Uh, Fontella's
Where you from?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Tachlinkov.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
What does that fucking mean?
What?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Um, five.
Bullshit.
Yeah.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Okay.  How did you find me?
Because he is trying to retire me.
No.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Women?  No... not really.
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
That's where he'll be.
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
Where did you learn it?
Check.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Thank you.
No.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
What are you doing?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?  I don't know.
No.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Do you ever regret things you've done?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you believe that?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Why not?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Taken.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Why didn't you fade?
That's correct.
Of course, senor.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
But we are underground?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Am I late?
No beer?
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
My God! What happened?
What are you on about?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
You capitalist pig!
So I hear.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
It's...42 56 76 .
Yeah, no problem.
I can't go with him.
Yeah, pretty well.
There shooting at something.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
But we could go to London and live in England.
I don't understand, it's your home?
There's nothing there for me.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
They'll do it.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Great....How long will it go for?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
No!
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
A drill, what are you up to?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Sure!
Later.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Have you lost all control of this city?
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
You saw him?
Late night.  You?
I could take after Dad, too.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Landon!
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
This play -- ?
What's with the friggin numbers?
You think so.
Saturn. Beautiful.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Oh. Just not at school...
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Maybe you inspire me.
You don't know what you want --
And why would that scare me?
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Hey.
Excuse me?
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
We can measure wind.
What do you actually know with religion?
Come on.
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What'd you tell your father?
Are you trying to seduce me?
You're worried about your college applications.
Jamie --
I should have told you sooner --
Anything you want.
That I want you to take me home.
Now? We just --
How're you doing?
I'm asking how much.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
You're in the play?
I care for her.
How about your family?
Your parents are divorced?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
For pay?
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Oh yeah.
Here's your jacket!
Hi, Marty.
What time does school start around here?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
The sunrise? What for?
What do I say?
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Operator, what's today's date?
What, am I radioactive or something?
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Oh, right, right... 
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
Marty, that would alter history.
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
You answered the door!
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Dick? Dick who?
No way!
Hi. where's Cato?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Yeah, I guess.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
Then why'd you do it?
Thanks.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Yeah.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
But it would hurt.
How bad off is he?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Everybody loves trout.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Fine.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
You didn't walk out here.
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
You.  Like the papers all say.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Go where?  Where're you going?
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
What's his problem?
So where's Buckaroo?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Please, Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
You wrote his scripts for him?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
What's that?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
To do what?
What do you do far a living?
Sound a little what?
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...This must be boring you.
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Yeah, but –
Well...
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
Yeah.
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Those your only bags?
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Anyway.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Where were you tonight?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
What are you doing here?
No, Nick, please --
Sometimes I really hate you.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I'm De...
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
You like playing games, don't you?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Don't get too cocky.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Did you think it was so special?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
You won't believe me.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
Routine.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I got tired of being played with.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I don't believe it.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Are you kidding me?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
You sure?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
It was an accident.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
She's a suspect.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
No. Should I have?
Is this finished yet?
The whole thing – painting.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Ten bucks apiece.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
That's good. At least they're interested.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Do you still love her?
What's with the wigs?
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Annina Nosei.
Is Jean Michel here?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I didn't see you.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Decipher?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
A primate?
Yup.
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
Should there be?
Yeah.
Paint it out.
You want me to put it here?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
About what?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Hi.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
That's great.
I don't eat junk food.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So shut up and keep painting..
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Admiring your handiwork?
Nope, I told her everything.
And the truth frightened her?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Working late?  I'm touched.
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
I am as well as can be expected.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Women.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
What is it?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Please be looking for me.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Keep it.
What are you talking about?
Mr. Freeze.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
We gotta get those locks changed.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Winded, old timer?
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
All the answers are numbers.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We all wear masks.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Nostrovia.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
That kid is amazing.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
Edward...
_We_ sure are.
Go ahead. You can say it.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Do you want a drink?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Boss! Jesus! They've --
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
And you want a --
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Do we know anything about him?
Scottish.
Did you really ask?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
David, I'm serious!
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
You're not going to ....
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Whoa, my life is cool!
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
...Two...
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
Where are his pants?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Where are your skulls and bones?
What happened?
3:30 I guess.
We were trying to scare your mother.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Beetle!
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
He's your cousin.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Any particular kind?
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Attic space.
What's happening to them?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hellooo!  How's school?
Otho, that's terrible.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... And please call me Robert.
No, Robert.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
... But he's...?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Thank you.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Did you lose something?
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Hello, Eve.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Chauncey...
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Can you see well?
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Yes. I am very hungry.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I understand.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Thank you, Ben.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
I agree.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Since you were a child?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Have you served in the Army?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Try again.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
... How are the kids getting along?
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Yeah...
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
Which one is Elijah again?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
You've always hated the animals.
What's that?
You were him last night, weren't you?
It'll never happen, fuckface.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Maxine...
I know. I'm sorry...
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
No. I understand perfectly.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Yes, well...
I'm right?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Hi.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
You're evil, Maxine.
Hello. Wendy.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Says who?
But of course.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Yeah, I saw them
She's not available.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
How'd you get this number?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Lotte called me.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Well what?
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
No. Sorry.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Your mother all right?
Yes?
Well, good luck with the job.
Yes ma'am.
Ya think?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
They good whitefolks?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
MAMA!
Her who?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
She left me. She's gone again.
Hey!!
Yeah?
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
What's a pederast, Walter?
What the fuck is he talking about?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I see.
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
In the briefcase?
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Far from it.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Yeah man.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Jeffrey--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
So who--
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Just for making the hand-off?
That...fucking...bitch!
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
...Huh?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Huh?
It is a fucking emergency.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, and you were--
You know this!
Oh, shit.
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Wha. . . Donny--
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Shit!
Who is this?
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Right, Dude.
Dude.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well?  Aren't you?
Oh, shit.
Walter--
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What?
What was that?
I'll heal.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Thank you.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Why?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
How do you feel?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Put it back in park, Blade.
And why is that?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Not that I'm in contact with.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
What took you so long?
Don't try to talk --
How can you be out here?
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Maybe I don't see it that way.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
You shouldn't be here.
Graffiti --
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Is it bad?
Please --
How could you be a part of this?
This isn't human blood.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
How do you like that? Right on time.
Blade --
You've been listening in the whole time?
Whistler!
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
He killed them?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--I'm not staying here!
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
What's she look like?
Oak?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Cheery little place.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Anna--
I don't know. Nightmare.
Nothing. I dunno--
What'd you dream?
I want to see something!
Absolutely.
Beer and weed is what I've got.
No fucking.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Cotter?
Where?
That's a "j."
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
What're you doing?
This isn't about us.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Sure. I'm sorry.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Shoot.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
What happened to my Dad??
Well... the couch would be all right...
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
What do you want to know?
Remy.
...So what're you doing tonight?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
I told you. I like you.
...What was that back there?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
Don't throw that out.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
You want to see him too, right?
Can I feel 'em?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Jeffrey.
Shit. You better tell me something.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Then don't talk about killing.
Hi. can I come in?
No.
Who is Don?
I'm doing it.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Dorothy. no!
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
On a ride.
Am I bothering you?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Where are they?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Okay. be careful.
Okay. okay.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah.
Everything okay?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I can't dance fast.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
No honey, I'm alright.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Excuse me?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
No.
I don't think so.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Yeah.  She told me.
You?
Murder.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
No more brothers, Diego.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Well, you know.  It's um...
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Who's the cheapskate?
Beautiful girls?
Yeah, well...
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I know.
You mad at me?
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
No.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Figured it out.
Source?  What about Derek?
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Well, here I am.  See?
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
For instance, something like this?
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Second name.
You afraid of these ...?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
It's true.
But I haven't shot him.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Of course. As soon as possible.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Where were we?
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
So she knew about his heart?
What about the will?
Cause?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
The official cause?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Objection, Your Honor.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I've got work to do.
That's ridiculous.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Tell the court about that, please.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
-- And what did you suggest?
You'll be sorry?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Yes.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
Then what happened?
What did he say?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What happened?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
He video taped you.
That bastard!
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Yes.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
No pain, no gain?
Yes.
I'm the photographer.
It's not my taste.
Yeah.
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Can I see you later?
What are you going you doing?
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
Why?
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
-- But it's Sunday.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
But Your Honor--
The witness will answer the question.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I'm not.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It had to get there somehow.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
SO!
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Mom's orders.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
Michael.
What?
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Did we want to?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Not this kind of heat.
Madge?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
How long you been married?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
So, how long you've been living here?
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Francesca.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Why did you stop?
I'm sorry. That was...
You get used to it.
Francesca?
You must get lonely at times.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
My mistake. I apologize.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Wonderful. Uh...
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
But you don't mind.
I had a temper.
What?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
For who?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
I don't know. Please...
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
You feeling better Franny?
I can't sleep.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Okay.
When did she decide this?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
He yours, sir?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Yeah?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You want us to move in here?
Where's the gangsta of love?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
You got a nice crib here.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Jimmy, you've got --
Where we'll always be...
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I lied.
Please.  It's for your own good.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
What else does she say?
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
I can't find you.
Let me see it.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
That building?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
Know what?
All right!  Where's the key?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar?  What is this?
We're family, Caesar.
I didn't expect --
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
No!  They're still on their way.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Got to think this through ...
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Tell them!  Tell them!
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
What?
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.
Not on duty, sorry.
How many'd you do?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
Who?
I guessed you were straight black.
Do you know him?
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
A beer?
Maybe.
I wanted to apologize.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
We're not that different, Corky.
He was in love with you, right?
Do you think you know me like that?
You said he washed the money?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Why?
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
There is no going back.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
He'll have to run.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
It's me.
I'm still here.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
I know you will.
Yes.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
What do you want to do?
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
...they won't let you go...
I don't know.
Keep it. 
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Yes.  Is he there?
Did you?
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I want to go home.
I won't hurt you.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Listen to what you want.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Where are we?
I should go.
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
xxxxxx
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
My husband's out looking for him.
Wait a minute --
That's the only angle.
What's that?
-- he accessed the account --
What the fuck is he doing?
...your ducts?
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Enough though, eh?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
Very smart.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Say it was a mistake.
We don't make mistakes.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Jack ...
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
It's my fucking life.
Why not?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Security.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Would you really, Sam?
The refund for Tuttle!
He is dead.
What's the matter?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I never signed the form.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
This isn't rare!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Mistake?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
But I could be anybody.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Where is she?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
I should be going. I just quit.
You're going to live.
You're not going to die.
What?
The first is always the best.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
Sleeping.
He's better, though, right?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Five years.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
Three legs.
That's too many.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
I hate vodka.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I quit! I'm through!
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
The brakes are shot.
How's he doing?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
He's crazy.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
They booted me out of Washington.
Ravenous homosexual.
A half hour in the lobby.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
How'd it go?
Then it went well.
Yes.
Ready.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Jane?
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
How do I get out of here?
Follow me.
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
I'll speak to you.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
One year...almost one year.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
How's it going?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Jane?
I'll wait for you till seven.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Who?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
I know.  I taped it.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
I knew what you meant.
What are you doing here?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Not even a little bit?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Where where...
Thank you.
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Walter...there's...
Put it in the middle of the room!
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
I know.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Yeah.
People seem to like my cat.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Police officer.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
Hello Mayolia.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
I don't think this is gold.
What's wrong with you!?!
Well, um... litter?
You're the guys from the movie!
You didn't like them.
Let me in.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You okay?
Hey there.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You broke up with my machine?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Hi.
How are you doing?
You want some water or something?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Hey, Buffy...
I didn't expect to see you.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Where?
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
I'm looking for you, actually.
To bring you... your birthright.
Ow.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Same one.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
I...
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Hi, Grueller.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Okay, let's go.
What happened?
Wit-tay.
I really was way way too too.
Oh, thank you very much.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Yes I do...
I knew it--you're seducing me!
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
She's dancing with me.
Crash, I didn't think you--
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
Oh my...  Don't leave...
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Don't tell anybody.
I want to be had.
He won't make love to me anymore.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
I got him on the knee!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
What do I gotta do?
Pussy.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Can I give you my testimony?
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Eight and twenty-four.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
What the hell's going on out there?
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Was I at that dinner?
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
A powerful man.
But what happens when they do find out?
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Hello.
Lester...
702 472 1862.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Yeah?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
...don't do it to me...
That's right, yeah.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Yeah.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Why not make them happy?
What is it?
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
But as much as they loved her...
Oh, fabulous.
Yeah.
Huh?
Okay.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...twenty-five thousand?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
So, what'd ya do with it?
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
You fuckin' whore!
You get down here!
I am not!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Not gonna let me in?
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
This is not the way to treat people.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Can't do it with both hands?
No, Sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Excuse me.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, I've been busy. 
I'm just trying to get in my house!
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Yeah?
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Carmine left?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Artie! Artie!
How are you?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I know.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
He's good. He's fine.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Mm.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on. Don't be scared.
A sponsor.
Nicky, please...
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
I'm here.
You are.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
I think that's it.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Stacy. 
This is Nick.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
They're havin' a good time too.
He's here.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Charlie M.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
You sure?
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Yeah.
The crowd bought it.
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...

No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
What's the matter...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
You're kidding.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
God, can you hear me!
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Yeah, she's okay.
Like you don't know...
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
But I'm blind.
You're late.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
What was that for?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
What's this?
He's seen both of us now.
You switched license plates?
And stop with the directions.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Do I know you?
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
I'm with two friends now.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
26th off Wilshire.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
She's gone --
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
The one in Brentwood.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
God, if he doesn't come back --
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
He had a gun.  I have it now.
At least one.
I thought it was inspired.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
You could've hit me.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Why are we stopping?
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
That's a reasonable possibility.
You're the man with the gun.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Some loyalty.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I don't know what you mean.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Don't worry.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Yeah?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Government business?
I thought so.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Then why doesn't she?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
Just cut his hair, you know.
Did I?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Scottish?
The accent, I suppose.
You old-fashioned?
What look?
That Dave?
What you thinking of, hon?
Tell him it hurt --
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Do you care, Jimmy?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.
I didn't mean to hit you.
Probably.
Absolutely.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Why, honey --
Come on.
Dil, this is Jude.
No.
I had to go to work!
Prescription. For my condition.
Good-bye, Dil
In a manner of speaking.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
What would you do for me?
Yes.
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
What was it?
You know her, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
That's wise, Tommy.
Do you now.
Have a look at him.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Leave us, Judie.
He's hot.
Leave me alone, Jude.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Of course. I forgot.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Aye, I do, Peter.
A hotel?
Who is he?
Right.
I seen your fucking face.
Do what?
What makes you think that?
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Absolutely not.
Hurry up, would you?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
See? I was right about you.
I've often wondered how you do it.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
Help me.
Take the hood off, Fergus --
You won't run.
Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
What about it?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
When you come on, you really come on.
Why?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Now what?
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Reggie -- please believe me!
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Only we call them agents.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Very sweet.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Describe him.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Me?
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Okay.
That sounds like their problem.
Or Tex?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
What do you mean?
You mean, you're a thief?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Meaning what?
What do you mean, no?
I don't know anything.
But his mother --
You loved him?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I don't know.
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
I don't understand.
Oh, la.
Why, do you think we're going to?
I don't know -- how would I know?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes.
How do you know?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
I wasn't --
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
I've never seen him before.
Who is it from?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Why?
I never fucked Rod.
I think it's funny.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
She's my daughter, Tom.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
You found her?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
This will relax her.
I can.
No, you couldn't.
Really?
Why?
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
You aren't going to the party?
Of course I'm scared.
Me? Why me?
Mark Shale.
No! That's his table.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
FINE. Are you?
Ok.
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
I'm fine.
Did Sharon say no?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I'll think about it.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Are you coming to the party?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Sharon's far from a slut.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
What?
Lisa Sherman?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
Why not?
The principal?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
No.
You can't bring it.
Rod!

No argument there.

He could've called first.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
All right, then how about this?
Go on.
Would you hurry up, please?
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
...-er.
...-er.
Yeah, borrowed!
God-...
Okay, okay! 

...-ed.


...I believe in live and...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
...man!
...up!
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...

Get over!  Get over!
Come on.
...Night Shift, but you might...
Whoo!
Holy--!

All right, let's go.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
...to him!  You don't know who...
I don't want you to come anyway. 
What?

Oh, no!
So I took his truck, yeah.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
 Whoo!
 

Reach into my pocket.
 Okay.
Okay. 

Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
Okay...



Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Who drove the ice cream...
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
I think so too.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Hey, be cool.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?


Mason, you have to take this...
...here.   Mason... 
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Listen, deputy.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
You'll kill us all!
You look good, Richard.
Mm-hm.
All right.  After they put you away...
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Hit him.
There.
Check the immediate area.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
 But...
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...deer.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
You try anything, it goes in...



...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
...son.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Who's your suspect?
...try this one out some-...
My secret?
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...the master of his realm.
Mason.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Where are you now...
Forty-seven.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
You redneck idiot, do you have...
The Army, sealin' us in.
  All right.
Gimme this god-...
 Talk to me.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
That's right.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
How did she get that idea?
Where from?
Would you call him a capable man?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
What for?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Avocado groves?
Is she all right?
Haven't the faintest idea.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
How much are you worth?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure thing.
Curly, where's your car?
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Thanks, Lou.
No. It was an accident.
What are you doing here?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
And why's that?
Too late for what?
Where?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
A complete surprise?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
What do you mean?
I got your check in the mall.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
K... Cross.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Over the water department, or over you?
Oh, yeah?
The Valley?
Maid's night off?
Working for the District Attorney.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Where are you going?
This morning.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
The police?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
Ida Sessions.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Oh my goodness.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
There's just one question.
I never was.
Yes?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
No, really?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Neither do I.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
I'm working for his daughter.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
Yes. 
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
No...
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
Mr. Kane -
I didn't see that.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Let him finish, Charles.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
Where's the soap?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Well, I -
I mean in New York.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
You goin', Mom?
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
Charlie -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
All right.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Hello, Brad.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
What's this?
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
That's the whole works, right up to date.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Who told you you could sit down here?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Are you serious?
It's not the same.
Jesus!
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
When did you get back?
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
I'm not pregnant.
I just told you.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
You're late.
Why are the shutters closed?
You called Caitlin again?
Did you tell Veronica?
Eight and a half?
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
All four?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
There's more?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Don't yell at me, pal.
At least we're stuck here together.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
No, you're not.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
She meant nothing to you!
Broke his neck.
No!
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Why should I loan you my car?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I like to expand my horizons.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Because I'm here.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
What responsibility?
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Why do you say that?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
To say the least.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Excuse me?
Yeah?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
What's that mean?
So.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Maybe.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
She called you, didn't she?
How much money did you leave up there?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
I touched a nerve.
How many?
How many girls have you slept with?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Where?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Really?  You're the best.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Sure.
What're you talking about?
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
What did he say?
That doesn't sound metal.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Look, I know--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
How're ya feeling?
Four...five...
That's a virtue isn't it?
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Where?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
You attacked me.
Thanks for holding on.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
This way.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
What did you do that for?
Of course. Food alright?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
No. She's dead!
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Do you feel that way now?
Who said that?
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Surprise?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Through there for a bath.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I haven't seen you before.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Shall we go to my office?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
What?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Where are you, what floor?
A deer?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Jesus...
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
What's your name?
What's he sayin'?
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
You always stutter?
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
I don't think I can do this.
Got it?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
It's a mess.
Yes.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
How can you kill him like that?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
What?
You mind?  I'm working here.
Show up for <u>what?</u>
Doesn't cover everything.
Dmitri?
I don't get it.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
You get benefits?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
You're going too fast.
Who?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I was only going one way.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
You bit someone's nose off?
Just relax.
Switch the charts.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Six months.  Eleven days.
Surprise me.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Never heard of him.
So what's the question?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Jerry, I --
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I'm sorry.
Without a song in my heart.
What's that?
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
You do recognize it then?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
Where do you think Jerry is?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
Hope there's a cartoon.
What in the hell...?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
What?  Why?
Actually I'm running late --
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Thank you?
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Talk to him.
Can you show me?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
Am I one... or many?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
Peter Valerian.
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
It's really happening.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Something like that.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
It was quite a page turner.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
But --
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Recommendations?
I'll make it a dollar.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
That's good: he earned it.
Lookit her bounce.
We saw the broads.
Please! Please!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Go git it, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Here, Captain.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Pair'a nines.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
A cold drink.
That's my baby.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Oh Lord!
Cuter again.
Man Oh Man.
It's good medicine.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Yes.  Without question.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
He was lying.
When he was seventeen.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never hurt nobody...
What Friday?
Where is it?
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Where are you, Peter?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Is it an ongoing case?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Is that it?
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
The lock...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Just horseshit luck.
Answer it.
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
How about I put Nikko on it?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
So what have we got?
Where you going?
What the hell you need her for?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
What!? They brought the car here?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Isn't that rather too close...?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
What does he want from you?
Crash victim?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
What do you think of this one?
What about the engagement party?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I gather he's late as usual.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
I'm really not that hungry.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
What's my rap?
Well?
I better make a list.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Are you OK?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
I guess I should go now.
Can I put these here for tonight?
Forget I asked.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
Do you know who this is?
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
A pass.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Hello?
-- Super what?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Hopefully no one.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
This is Zero.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
All right, knock it off.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Maybe you should call the police.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
What about transportation?
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I'll drive.
Anybody know about that car outside?
J&amp;B?
When do we go?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Did she break your heart?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
She seems pleasant enough.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Yes.
Then leave her to me.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
And if I use them to kill you?
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Don't bother.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're doing calligraphy?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Kneel!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Good.  And how are you?
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
What was it?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
I knew she would intrigue you.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Shu Lien...
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
But the sword could be in his compound.
You buying?
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
How 'bout the morgue?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
In a better place.  I hope.
Mom tried to cook.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
You don't even remember...
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Another jolly nickname?
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Does it hurt?
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
An unexpected pleasure.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Have we met?
Thank you.
From who?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
The Fountainhead.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
How about tonight?
No, not at all.
What are you reading?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
What?
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Good for you.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Any ideas who it could be?
Where did you find those?
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
See that wasn't so bad.
No.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
You think he'll like it?
I want to go home.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Whoa!
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Hello.
What do you mean?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
I'm working on it.
Call me later.
You would not believe what--
Any day now.
Who are you calling?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You didn't?
Oh yes.
Excuse me?
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Will you calm down?
And if I don't?
I think you have your answer.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Hi. Is Annette at home?
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I said, do you want some water?
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
What song, dear?
Did your wishes ever come true?
On the back street — a green house
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
It's your play.
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Hello, Amy.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Why didn't you run after them?
But where do you come from?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I shall want you for always.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That's right!
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It stands so still.
May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Look at my ring.
It's a pretty ring.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
How's the rest of your health?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Does she have PMS?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I think she broke the skin.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
So did you do it?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
At least your PMS is over.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
Holy shit, I don't know.
No.
Peter knows something.
Fall in love.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
I think George knows.
Frida? You okay?
I do development for TV movies.
Uh huh. So pee.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Did you change your hair?
Are you following me?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
It's stupid.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
You had a date with Carlton?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
You didn't say it.
Peter I love you too but...
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
How the hell is that your business?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
What of?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
Good evening, sir.
Lost something?
Dammit!
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
Then we must call the police.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Yes.
Horrible...
It's a trick.
What happened to you?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Don't say a .
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Choices???
Just don't call him, Alan!
I don't give a shit.
Is that everybody?
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
It's a homeless shelter.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Do we have anything on the budget today?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Dave -- I'm working.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
I'm not sure... I might have.
What?
Thanks, I wrote it.
President vetoes works bill?
What do you mean you made it all up?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
I can't say.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You ever use it?
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Anybody would have done it.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Hi.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Please....shoot me.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Datura.
How long do we have to watch him?
What?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
What?
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
Yeah.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
What is the point?
Well...
Oh God, it's over now!
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
What?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Sort of.
But, Chris...
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Are you going with Chet?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
Very good, Mr._?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
Again!  Louder!
LOUDER!
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
All right!  What'd she say?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
You know me, always taking on too much.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
I'll take him over mine.
What is it then?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
What is that supposed to mean?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
I'll come to the performance.
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
You're going to have to get a new one.
Where are my men?
Anti social?
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
Yeah...
Where's you friend?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
I think he knows that Joey.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
A little to the left...
And what have you come up with?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Check it out!
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Tell him, Vince!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Whee-uu!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
You talk to him?
I came to see Merle.
You are his friend.
Holy shit!
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Okay.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
No.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I... No. You do this for money?
Playing?
This is horrible!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
The shot?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Nick, he just came back.
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I like it, Nick.
No!!!?
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Yeah!
No!
You're full of shit!
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Technothugs?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Funny guy.
I'm wasting time.
Kill him... kill him.
Not the 'T' word.
Are you a cop?
I'm ready.
I'll inform dispatch.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Rip Van Winkle.
How ya feeling?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
I just heard.
No.  I want to be with you.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Bye.  Thanks.
Hi.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
You know that you're in my house.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Why? It don't hurt.
What's that, sir?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
It's mine?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Leave your tongue off of that!
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
About what?
You know darn well it is.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
What -- what's on your mind?
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
There's no joy in it for me.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
You want me to go around --
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Why not -- ?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Mary -- what would you do?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
But I'm glad to be home again --
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Isn't that your own fault?
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Let him try it.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Jabez ...
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
You mean -- a jury trial?
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
No, sir.
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Nothing...
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Encourage them to be bolder.
What are you doing?
Oh...Where does he live?
...I've missed you.						*
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
Roy?  You still with us?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Yeah.  So how are you?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Shit...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Yeah... yeah!
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
What kind of things, Leon?
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Sonny, be reasonable!
What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
What's the matter with you?
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Where's the back door?
Now, you -- what's your name?
Sure - we like you.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
... The bodies out the door.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Sal?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Bullshit!
What's wrong?
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Oh - Maria!
I forgot she's in here.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
This is Drake Bishop.
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
So what?
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
<i>The FBI was breathing down Lateesha's neck... and she assumed that they were onto our scam. So she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist. They have been under FBI surveillance for the past 6 months.</i> <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN </b> Claremont drives like a maniac.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
I don't know.
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
How did you meet Choco?
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Something is going down. Something bad.
What did he say about the arm?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Don't come back, either.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
Where did you sleep?
Ten.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Nice!
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
That's my name.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
You keep it.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
When?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Trust me.
Be a man.
You deaf or what?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
I was going to buy a slice.
I understand.
I know this.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
No, I'm not it.
Oh my god, are you alright?
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
What are you wearing?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
I know I am, Mom.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
I go to school where I live.
Cool.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
You take that back!
Where did you learn that word?
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
Collins is a great man!
According to the map, we're just about at school.
You can't marry my mom.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
HARRY, can you hear me?
You have beautiful eyes.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
No one knows?
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
She's one of a kind.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
You had some questions.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Yes, what?
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Well, something stinks.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Hey you two. Lights out.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Times two.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
It's a surprise.
You got the Extender?
JESSICA. Are you sure?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
My thanks.
Yes?... How was your journey?
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
As the legend says.
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
He knows.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Why do they come?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
What can be done has been done.
It is my home.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
No.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Why were you buying a coffin?
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Are you sure this is okay?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
I didn't feel well...
What's in the needle?
What is this place?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Once you're in it, it warms up.
What are you doing?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
And, cut...
Um, okay... roll camera
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Wow.
No!  A horror movie star!
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
It's a damn good role.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Mr. Wood?!
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Can I help you?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Are you a fruit?
OUR picture?
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Um, I guess --
Maybe it needs special handling.
Hello.
I just picked them up on the way over...
Did you find it boring?
What was that?
Well you tried --
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Those assholes.
Let's get married.
I'm really sorry...
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
What octopus motor?
You know, to make the legs move --
What the heck is THIS?!!
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
No! Do they show you having sex?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yeah, so... ?
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
No.
Excuse me.
Cool.
Uh-huh?
Yeah.

Really? They were..
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Right.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Mm.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Oh my God!
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
What's the difference?
What's the matter?!
Ed! How did you know I was here?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
She left.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
I can't?
Our what?
How much less?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Cream rinse?
Dynamite.
Well, when you put it that way.
Go!
Really?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
That's lucky.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
So?
I'm sorry.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
It's not their fault.
What?
What are you drunk?
You're in show business?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Hi.
... Ray?
You know what your problem is?
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
No. Two times.
What...
Oh, man! So...
What does that have to do with... ?
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
In love?
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
NO, that's fine
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
So... what do you have to tell me?
And how did you get in the school?
Should we get a what?
No way I It doesn't make sense.
What?
Where 're you going?
People can see this.
I mean at you.
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Yeah.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Don't you fucking knock?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Now could you leave me alone?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
How'd she meet Patchett?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Do you enjoy it?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Call me Dudley.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
How what, Wendell?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe.  I don't know.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
What do you mean?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I don't have time.  I have --
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Man, what're you saying?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
No.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
What about you?
Damnit...
I need to speak to you.
So what's the point?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
Decorated?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
It seems like my Susan, but...
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Under the house.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Have we met before?
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Brill?
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Listen to me--
Listen--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Yeah.
What <u>is</u> that?
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
They're here.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
You sure?
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
No he won't.
Goddammit--
What about newspapers and magazines?
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
What if--
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
What are you dialing?
Very good.
Eight.  Size eight.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Because my life is being ruined.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
To buy lingerie.
Right.
He's got his priorities?
You <u>swore</u>!
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Is it over?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
This conversation's over.
He didn't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Mr. Dean--
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Some of 'em.
No.
What about jewelry?
The blender?
No, but they took my blender.
Bobby--
Yes.
Jesus.
Listen to me.
Tell me about it.
The police?
You would?
Yes sir.
What?
Am I to understand--
Hiding something?
Sir--
No thank you.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
Excuse me?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
You should come into the shelter.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Do they know them?
No.
I can still taste you.
This is empty, just coming!
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Don't talk.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Oh dear.
What kind of photographs?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
In my room.
What's the matter with you?
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
You were in Africa?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
I don't know what that means.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
For?
I see.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
To arm-twisting.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
He needn't disturb you.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Why?  Is he staying?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I try not to expect you.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Will you come with me?
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
How awful.  What will you do?
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Meaning--
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
He's on to something bigger.
Uh. I'm showing off.
How about if I try humility.
Seems I am.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
You're not taking me seriously.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
I don't believe this.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
I'll need that.
Let's do it again.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Won't take any time.
To us. To the Mask.
Terrified. Still am.
Aren't we all.
The big job.
We're living history here.
The Mask. Where is it?
That's where the Mask comes in.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
No way to take another day or two?
Four billion dollars.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
Thought you had to use some of these.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
What the hell is this doing here?
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
The judge came up with a number.
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
So what made you think it was?
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
Is that what I think it is?
You didn't care about my case?
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
What kind of truck?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
And if you had to guess ...
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Erin?  What are you --
I was wrong.
What is that?
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Have you been to the water board?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
She's one of the sick people?
Hey -- those are my files --
You want my number?
You got more than one?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
No.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
What're you doing?
You are someone.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Nothing.
What do you want, a joke?
That's Ed.
Thank you.
Hello?
What time is it?
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Who's Baxter?
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I can help them!
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Because of my father, I guess.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Yes, Your Highness?
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
An Imperial probe droid.
I take it back.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
How do I look?
Yes, you do.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Can you trust him?
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I don't like this.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I was worried about you.
About what?
Hyperdrive.
Get out of here, Lando!
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
We have no use for your kind.
Jabba the Hutt?
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
But we saw Earth destroyed.
Go easy, Stevie.
Who's that?
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
I need a favor.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
Shut up, Plissken.
Not you?
Locked.
Plissken...?
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
How do you know all this?
I don't know about this thing.
Yeah, kinda.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
You saved me from the arrow...
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Guenevere...
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
I'm going.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
Why didn't he kill us?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
To kill and be king, is that all?
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well what's wrong?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
No, he's working on another book.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Here.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Where do you want this?
We still don't know.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Rats?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
She is going to be well?
What!
Is it coming out Willie?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Where?
No I didn't know you had one.
No.
Is she gonna die?
I found it.
Yeah.
Wait a minute you need two.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Cause I like it.
You like him.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
You'd like that?
Ego te abslovo.
Dimmy, you worry for something?
And let my cry come unto thee.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Amen
Only what I read in the papers.
I once did a paper on it
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Yeah, a fall.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Twelve.
You're not going to drive.
Little slow tonight.
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Am I late?
Jack.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
What's wrong with it?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
Jack...
Why the interest?
This time you gotta go.
I made her nervous.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
The hell you don't.
It wasn't like that.
Talk.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
That's what we agreed.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
What's the matter?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
You all right?
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Unless you want the right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
Funny, huh?
February?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
They were simple songs.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
What're you doing?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
Nothing. We get nothing.
You don't know?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Actually, that's my stage name.
I'm sorry?
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
So?
What's the problem?
We're a team.  We work together.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Nine?
Maybe it's legit.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Some discussion.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Funny hours.
Funny job.
Right.  Bring him back.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Fucking.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Who's Nina?
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
The both of them?  In there?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Frank said ---
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
What kind?
Huh?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Guess they're up.
What are they?
Yeah?
Huh? Oh, no.
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
So?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
It's important.
... I was dreaming ...
So you had a nightmare.
No.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
What are you going to do!
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Commander, what are you doing here?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
What?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
I'm just having some fun.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What's that?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
You're wearing your suit --
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Oh, that Karl.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Why Jack?
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
What about me?
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Rise...and...shine...!
We’re almost done here...
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Is it morning yet?
We’re friends, aren’t we?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Yeah?  What do you need?
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
It would help me if we were.
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
How’d you do this year, Tony?
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Here you go...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Really.
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
I’m out of the doghouse?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
That’s the one...
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Mrs. Peterson.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Where is he?
He certainly has your number, Alan.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, are you okay?
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
You got a chisel round here?
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
I'll be watching over you.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What did you wish for, honey?
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
You're hot!
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
What are you doing --
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Leonard, how's the feed?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
What's going on?
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
I know that. But what's the maximum?
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
What're you getting at?
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Shouldn't you answer that?
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Doctor, what's wrong?
But that isn't possible.
We can't take a second more.
Yes...
You left something out.
How does it look, Doctor?
If there's any chance --
You have no right to blame Duval --
That line was tampered with...
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Where we going?
Come on -- it's no use!
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Then don't drift down further.
The Wall's transparent...
What do you mean?
No Jean, no money!
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Any others?
Yah, he -
Both of these.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Yah, got a front movin' in.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh.
Where you girls from?
Uh-huh.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
Yeah, but -
What... What is it all about?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yah, so we're all set.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Okay.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Where're you going?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, okay.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
...There's a million dollars here!
Mm.
Call 'em up.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah?
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Nope.
Yah, is this Marge?
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
It's just the three cent.
And his wife?
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
He's at Norstar.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
Well -
We're still men.
No.  I found something new.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
Yes?
No, I wasn't aware...
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
You're kidding.
So you're staying in tonight?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Make sure.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
No.
He's not here.
Marla...
You got about thirty seconds.
Marla...
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
What do you do, Tyler?
Thank you.
What?
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
But a good strange.
Unbelievable, huh?
Yeah, I'm sure.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
Tyler...
What the hell ... ?!
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
This conversation...
"Too young?"
Why do people think anything?
The house is rented in your name.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
I quit.
Can't you call it off... ?
What?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
I swear on my life, I won't...
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Yes, it is.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
What list?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
What did you see?
No!  It can't be.
Should we knock?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
What?
Maybe.  What's this about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Yeah?
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
How do you know?
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
Can I ask you a question?
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
"It?"
Is that something you're "feeling?"
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
That... him?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Police are coming.
You know what to do.
No! No! Don't!
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
What's that?
You read me, Brewer?
Read you.
Batteries not included.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
What's the job?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Christ almighty.
Black.  No sugar.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
I know...
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
But now it's free, right?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
You still believe in God?
The moron?
He's not a moron.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
Thanks.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Uh... basement I think...
You a friend of Parry's?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Hello Lydia?
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Huh-huh.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Oh, Lydia!
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
That's O.K.
But I gave it to you!
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Beautiful night huh?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
You advise us!
I don't like horror movies!
There isn't any more to tell.
Divorced.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I love it.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
No.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
Who?
No substitutions.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Robert...
I have to talk seriously with you...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
I'm talking to you, Tita!
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Pardon me?
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Miss Dupea.
Not now, I'm busy
Who are you?
Wussup?
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
So you got a girl?
Of course.
I did.
Eddie from Compost?
Fa what?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
You looking for somebody?
What she look like?
Your friend must be misinformed.
I'm a good friend of hers.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
I know how ta get him back if you want.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
It was planted on me, sir.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Your aunt?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Harry S. Truman?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
Has he?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Because we can't.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
So why pick me?
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Do you have a passport?
Only if you promise not to return me.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
Thanks.
She's cute as a button.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
You ordered it here?
I mean put clothes on.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
Don't worry, I can take it.
You shouldn't be here.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
You want I set up?
Lock's busted.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Tell the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Irwin...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Get out of here.
What...
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Frieda's boss.
You don't know the Underhills?
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Ford, you were right!
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Gut feeling.
Ouch.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
'Booty Time.'
The point?
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Fuck me...
I'm still the king!
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
No - no.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Where do you want it?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
What's your story?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Drink this.
Suspicion of what?
Why not?
Timezit?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Yeah.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
How do we get to the vault door?
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
How's that?
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Uh, hello?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What's going on?
That's impossible.
No, not yet.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
But that's tomorrow.
Chief?!  Is that you?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Something happened, something...
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
John, you still there?
Yeah, I think so...
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Please, Dad, just do it.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Got a minute?
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
You used to be on the job?
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Cool it, Andy.
What was that?
How about a roll in the hay?
It's dark down there.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Ahh, nothing.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
No.  No, it's not...
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
That's debatable.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Boy scouting.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Eight times.
Well, let's hope not!
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
So let's talk.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
What do you want?
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Never.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Well...how do you feel?
This is Jason's fault!
Jason's here in New York.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
What are you doing??
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
I...I don't know...
But I didn't get you one...
But Rennie...
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
I'm not ready.
No, we're not.
What are we talking about?
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
We're able to surprise each other.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
How prominent?
Opening night, Lillian.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
I can't find it.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It's a complicated subject.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
Yessiree, Bob.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
There was a review.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
God gave you ten thumbs.
I thought you were a man of God.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
What'd he say?
It was one incident.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
You've done me a great service.
Are you going to walk all the way?
You mean a general strike?
They're sparing no one, I see.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
You're an extraordinary man.
Who are you trying to convince?
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Er, no...
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
That's the last.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Who died?
You wish.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
What makes them think that?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Where are we going?
You may as well invite her here.
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
I hope he's not just a body.
I've found him too.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why don't we say we were together?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
Why are we leaving?
A year is a long time.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
I'll take care of my end.
Yeah.
Is he straight?
Doc...
I don't want to go there.
You sent me to him.
What do you want to do?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
No scars?
We got this far.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
No more about Beynon.
Things can't get much worse can they?
How long before this car's hot?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Two.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
You serious?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
You do what he says, Harold.
That right?
You can trust him...
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
I made a mistake.
What?
I made a mistake.
Yes.
Why?
That's not good enough.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Where's he living these days?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Who?
How'd you know where I'd be?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
And what was that?
Is he coming here?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Have another?
Thanks for coming.
Where you going to live, then?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Don't know.
See you later.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I won't be using the room tonight.
Are you a traveller?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
My brother, Frank.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
Now just a minute...
Are you awake?
Is he?
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...they hold on to their money...
...this shit...
Eh?
You get a bad month, all of a...
Eh...?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
That's what I...
They...
What?
Yes.
You...
I'm sorry?
Dave.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
They're going to come to everyone.
No.
Yes.  I'm sure.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
You went for it.
And why is that?
I, you know, they should be insured.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Everything I...you know...
Were the leads...
Yeah.
They aren't?
No.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
You have nothing to hide.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Shelly: get in the office.
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
...then...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Because I say so.
Get 'em to me!
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Yes.  I hear you.
Yes, I am.
I...
Because I don't like you.
How was it...?
Yes.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
I've got to talk to you.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
I don't understand.
I'm not.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
No.  She told me "right now."
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Have a good trip.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Do you like them?
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
What took so long?
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
That's what I'm here for.
It was hard to have him killed.
That's off now.
I'm going to see my parents.
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I asked about Fredo?
Was it a boy or a girl?
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
It might show.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Kay.
How's the baby?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I had no idea...
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
The baby I lost...
Who's asking?
You said you were Klingman.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
I want you to help me take my revenge.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
We got no choice.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
What's to be jealous of?
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
It still hurt.  A lot.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
No!
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
But I didn't do this!
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
It's new.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
So we understand each other?
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
What happened?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Do you miss it?
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
You were a soldier?
This was World War I?
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Let's get out of this funk hole
It's not like her.
Is that --?
No.  It won't do.
I don't know.
What was that?
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
I can undress myself, thank you.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Yes.  Perfectly.
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
This is the studio where I paint.
Yes?
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
What about?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
What kind of job... ?
It seems she neglected to mention it
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
I know you.
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Your girl works in there ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
Double-meaning intended --
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
What does that mean -- ?
You look good...
oh.
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
I know...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Any more ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
I heard you were pumping gas -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Nah. It's a scratch.
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Come here -
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
You know of one -- ?
Buy you a drink?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
That's what I want ...
Very good...
No ... ?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Slip it in ...
Now... I'm in ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
What about The Club ... ?
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Is he still working here ?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
So she flies -
What about me?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Which way's out, man -- ?
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Billy, how are you?
No more shines, Billy.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
What do you do?
What bag?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
I got seared.
What about the schools?
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
You know what to do?
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
I hate to do dishes.
Are you okay? What happened?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He's with his friends.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
You want a partner?
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
She's sharp as a marble.
What?
She went to Medical school in California.
It's a way outta here.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
No, I had to talk him down.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
Yah, all right...
Did she get my Double Burger?
Some other guy?
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No students work for me.
What're you doing?
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
Will.
Yes.
Hello.
Since Nancy died.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
I do.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Sean...
What should I do?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
What did you think?
Yes, I do.
Tell me what you really think.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Where were you?
That's right.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
What did you think?
What?
Not to me, they're not.
I didn't ask for this.
Oh, I know.
I know.
You're Welcome, Will.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Do you keep in touch with them?
They don't come over here that much.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Want me to take a look?
It's important that I learn this.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Come with me to California.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Then what are you afraid of?
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
What about your twelve brothers?
Yeah.
How 'bout you?
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Short fella. Pale face.
Four.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
That's the way it is.
An' you say no cops?
Why ain't they more like it?
*You* find out, I can't.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
You're right!
What's the matter?
Thought you was in jail.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Lookin' for a job?
Yeah.
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
California.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
How 'bout it?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Don't taste bad.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Didn' you get no sleep?
No.
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
They know what--this fella looks like?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
What's these?
In the corporate offices.
--No.
Computer guy.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Watched television?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
I was leaving.
You kill people. 
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
This?
He didn't.
Enough?
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
Fine!
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Mom?
Maybe they should put me down too.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine!
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Don't they believe in signs here?
Why? There's no food in the house?
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Started what?
Who's going to want me now?
What?
Let's bring your bags inside.
So do you.
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
She will if you think she should.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Was the trip okay?
You want to take a walk with me?
Oh, I don't know...
No. He had the choice.
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
She calls him Tommy...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Promise?
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Mixed salad.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Tom?
Would you let me ride your horse?
It's warmer than I thought.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
You want to watch some television?
What stuff is that?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
How's it going, Ray?
Let's keep her.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Hold on a second!
Ta-da!
Damn!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
I want it to have my children!
Dead.
Revenge.
Shit! Come on!
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
And you have to smile.
Uh, hold on...
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
You look good in a dress.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
You think they're going to bust us?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
What does that mean?
Shit!
Go!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Honey, I don't think their home.
How do you know their not?
How many people in the bus?
Watch it.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
Who you calling?
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Rachel come on.
Rachel!
You won't look pushy.
I don't know.
Right here, Ben.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Jamie! Get away!
We just talked.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
He was standing right here.
Hello?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
He can still watch.
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Get him out of here!
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
They could be.
Where?
TOTALLY!
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Why are they under there?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
PROBABLY going.
Are there any special instructions?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Mmm?
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
I know.  It's terrible!
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
Yes.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
You're out looking here?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Bye.
Yeah.
Isn't that beautiful?
I thought you weren't coming.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I didn't say that.
Are you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Hmm?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Hello?
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Like what?!  What?
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
No.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Oh, great.
Oh, yeah?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Ohh!
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Perfect!
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Frederick didn't come with her.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Awwww...
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
You're crazy!  That's not true.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
Good.  How are you?
Yeah?
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Probably not.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Okay.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Or, perhaps...
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
...why?
...they did it for a lark.
Who would that be.
That's right.
I know her by the Back.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Where was the call from.
...they're from Baltimore....
I won't take much of his time.
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
No. 
Yes sir, I saw it. 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I know you did what you could.
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
I'm an orphan.
I said sometime it gets so...
Waal...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
How so?
Is it necessary to know?
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Don't shoot yourself.
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Then we cannot go.
Hello....?
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
My encounter.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Howdy Pouty.
Man, she's losing it...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Go stand by the flagpole.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
God, you're beautiful.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
I said I was sorry.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
Veronica, you look like hell.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Probably....
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
S'okay....
Good plan.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
You must have had fun.
Did you miss him completely?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
You know what I want, babe?
You going to eat this?
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
You have to let me go!
Oh-what a nice outfit!
She's terribly hurt . . .
I think I'm dying . . .
What??
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Second most common?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
No.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Since what?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Kirsty... Kirsty?
What?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
I don't work here.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
-Tawny.
You got a drinking problem or what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Mister LaPlante...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Here.  Get off here.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
Unprofessional.
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
You didn't?
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
I didn't ask him.
Who?
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Are you being helped, sir?
I understand that.
Who doesn't?
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
About what?
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Did you hear that?
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
How long does it have to be a new house?
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Just reduced.
Let's follow 'em.
Shit!
I have a cold.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
What is it?
Where were you last night around nine?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
The river.
I'm sure they will.
To ask her to dance.
I would like to say goodbye.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Corpses?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
You're hurt.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Talley.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Who sent you?
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
There is no way out.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
We been through that.  Forget it.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
All right.  Now the second one.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
I don't drink beer.
What happened?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Louise?
Chief, base.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Chief, Mikkelson.
Are all of you named Jones?
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What are you people going to do?
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
What do you mean by that?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
You want to pay me?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Their people?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
What did they say?
Satellites?
And what will they do with these satellites?
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
I will see what I can do.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You lie.
You will tell them the truth.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Very soon.
Mr. Manager.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
What?
I couldn't help.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
The president has been murdered.
Has Roger spoken yet?
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
But who is left?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
So where is the lamb?
In Ruhengeri?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Where has all our beer gone?
Thank you, sir.
When?
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
Oh, really: who?
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Pritchett, is that you?
This is nuts.
Why?
I don't think so...
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
Cheery looking bunch.
It's succeeding!
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You're hurting me.
What are you talking about?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
-- I pose you the same question --
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Good way to get your head blown off.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Rewind that.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Don't know that it does.
Won't do any good.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- I'm coming --
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
It looks delicious...
Are you all right?
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Well then who did?!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
I can't move!
Mommy please help me!
You didn't think much about that before.
I wish I knew more about her.
So what are you saying?
A friend?
I think we should do it.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Keep talking!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Do you mind if I borrow it?
What?
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Wha .... ?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
You gonna buy?
Thank you.
What ... What ... ?
Joey?
JP?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Alex!
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
You sound disappointed.
Anna, I think you better stay....
Alex, are you....
A little petting is not the issue!
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Hudson, don't you understand...
I wanna know...
Cat got his tongue?
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
This is the worst night...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
The Dancing Dingus!
The Hoopsucker!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
It's hardly the same --
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
You're from Muncie?!
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
...Why don't I just type this up...
...Huh?
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Your i --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Norville!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Watch it, Archer --
Tell me about it.
How long've you been down here?
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Awwww, buddy --
...It is?
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Yeah, tell me about it.
Hello, Niagara.
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
You don't believe in it?
Mrs. Rand.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Yes.
The West Indies?
But it's so far away...
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
Help me? How?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I told you.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
No thank you. We should be off.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
What do you think?
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
That shirt?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Don't start.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
In the car.
You're not going to --
I'm not.
I'll drive you --
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Grades?
Anyone special? You know...
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Talking to me, dad?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
What?
It's what?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
You okay?
Nobody.
Please don't.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Yes.
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Now you are being rude.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Huh?
Just be careful.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Yeah?
Want some gum?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Yeah. Yours?
Hey Sandy.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
What are you doing?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
He's dead.
I have to get back.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
She your only sibling?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
What I saw?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
No.
Where you signed this?
Randy Stetz?
Are you sure about that?
They're all over everybody.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
You don't know.
That's a long time.
Who?
What was it?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
No.
There's nothing more to talk about.
What the hell do you know?
So you have the answers...
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, I swear I did not.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
I'm not your daughter.
But you're the fairest by far.
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
Don't mock, Claudia...
How do I look?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
This is monstrous!
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Then my luck would have changed.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
It can't be...
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
We belong in hell.
I don't pretend to know.
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
How did you do that?
You're not lying to me, are you?
The story about stakes through the heart?
How could I not? She had to know.
Lestat escaped the fire!
You're in 201 and 202.
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Storm season?
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Stupid. Stupid.
No.
What are you doing in my closet?
No.
The number's unlisted...
Okay, okay. You're right.
I'm the King of the World.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
I don't know...
No, you're not.
Yeah.
I understand something.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Julie? What's wrong?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Ahh, that feels great.
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
You guys lost?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
He is exhausted.
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Goodbye.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
All the graves?
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
What are you doing?
What is it -- what are you talking about?
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
That your father and I ——
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't understand you.
Hero?
Do you mind if I go with you?
There is something evil about her.
How did she die?
Listen to what I say --
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
No, of course not.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Yes, George?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
George Bailey.
What's that?
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Well?
Well, sure I do.
Today, over at the house.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
You want a martini?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Huh?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, hello.
I'm not very good at this.
Eighteen.
Do you like it?
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
After that, who cares?
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Yeah, just started.
Where're you going?
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, George, George!
You can?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Don't!
Maybe by now they are.
Why not?
That's awful.
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
What is it?  What's there?
In here.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Every day?
Pop....
Hey, come on....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
Hey!  That's my boss!
Where's my day book?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
No.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We're alone.
Two of them are still missing!
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Yeah?  Then what?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Some people.
Hi Dad.
Is that me?
What's wrong?
What's that mean?
Nope.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Power line.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Maybe.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Wave to my son.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Hope I make it through both.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
That macho pompous English --
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Hi, baby.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Fine piece of engineering.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
So tell Calvin.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
Go where?
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
No, no.  That won't do.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
We're taking that shark alive!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Not at all.
Why are you?
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Believe me, I am.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He's a young one.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Hi, Mike.
How you doing, Kelly?
So, you just get here?
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
Sure am.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Take it up!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Now what?
Don't you dare.
Yes, there is goes.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
I want to see Kathryn.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
But you always let me....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
Then don't come any closer.
You want to try your hand at something...?
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
That....
He heard that.
No, no...It's too dangerous....
What?
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You look tired....
I have to get this finished.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
You're always taking time off....
I borrow it without telling him....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Grab your socks....
You sure you know how to do this.
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop busting my hump....
How many...?
They won't fight with me....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
What's so funny about that?
How come only me?
You don't like my voice...?
It'll work....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
I'll do it, Jake.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
When he has a pillow over his head....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Did you bring it with you?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
The <u>dogs</u>?
What time is it?
You want my advice?
You gotta stop smoking ..
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Where is everyone?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
What do you want it for?
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
What if we need a back up?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Three or four.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Yes.
Oh.
Are you married?
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
You know? How do you know?
You got a warrant for this?
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
He's happy, darlin ..
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Who told you?
Well, no you didn't --
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
No one has ever dumped me.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Well, take care.
Oh tsht. Yes.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
It's all going to work.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Don't worry about it, boss.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
You want...
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
Good.
Please, if I start talking --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Said who?  Sugar?
Another drink please.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
I understand your anxiety.
What's wrong.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm sorry I asked.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Jerry!  You made it --
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
To the pools?
You gonna get that --
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Oh, my God.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Well what?
We should try fishing again.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Where's Dad?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Hmm?
You remember the sounds they made?
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Why?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
I have never been on this island!
Billy!
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
It matches the pictures.
Any damage?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
What are you talking about?
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
My vacation is over in a week.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
No.
We can't stay in here!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Head for the roof!
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
So that others would know about this place?
What?!
Phones are out too.
But would we get the phones back?
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
They smell.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Constantly sick.
Not just every six weeks.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
The fences are electrified, right?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
Yeah.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
Machines hate you?
You're sure?!
Oh my God!
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
What kind of opinions?
Tim!  Lex!
What's that?
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
What works?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Don't do that!
Your silence intrigues me.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Why did you do this?
That's not funny.
That's not true...
Jesus Christ!
I think we're lost.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Other guy?
What's going on?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Who's chest?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
How do we prove it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
And if he's not?
Where do you live?
You look like brothers.
I read the one about the penal colony.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
You work in the cemetery.
Yes.
Did you see him?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
I've heard of it happening.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Gabriela ...?
They're dead now.  We can get help.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
What was it, Jack?
They were just tasting the berries.
What?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Are you gonna start it up?
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Don't belong?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Didn't want you.
Well I have to close up now.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Oh no.
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
Gee.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
You remind me of my uncle.
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Can't you get him?
No.
Try some other ways. 
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
No, I said what did you think.
Well --
Arlyn Page.
What?
I am.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
What?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I've just got a few --
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
What do you like best about her?
Greatest.
Mom, I mean dad?
Yeah?
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
I hate it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
You're no bargain either, pal.
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Was there apple juice when you were little?
What don't you understand, pal?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection!
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
I was not a failure.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
What?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Fine.
Oh, Christ!
It's going to cost.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
How the hell are you going to do that?
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
You're on your own, understand?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Thelma, if I die--
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Yes, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
I will buy them for you.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Me. First break of day.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
Do I have money?
Roughly five thousand men.
Will we be in this war?
America, we shall see.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Good day.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
You will not come?
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
I do.
We cannot.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Much too young.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
You killed him.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Thank you.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
Mr. Cyr!
I'm laying a spring trap!
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Was he a good man?
Promise you won't kill me, first.
What's that?
I can arrest you!!
Such the flirt.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I'm okay.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Who?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Good.  See ya soon.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Like little children.  You okay?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Ssssh!
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Alright, Jack!
Okay.
Are we crazy?
He's mooing.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
I'm ready when you are.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Thanks for your help.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Is the dead guy in there?
This is a little different.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Yes.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
You threw it at me!!
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
That's not what you came to say.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Kevin told me you were upset.
Hot damn, Clarice.
I will... I promise.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
I think so.
Yes.
And the questionnaire...?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
He kills w-
All right, then tell me how -
Starling.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
We leave in the morning?!
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Maybe...
You do not know what you are saying!
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
That is the truth!
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
Got a reason to stay.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Sergeant Major!
Sir!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Yes.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
You mind if I take a look at this?
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Doc eat already?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
No!
That's an order!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Okay.
If he had his blinkers on--
Itches like hell.
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Clear for pickup.
The shack...
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
There are no others.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Son?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Er well, yes we do.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
No.
Invitations.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
. . . What?
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
You got it all?
I'll see ya.
It's pay day, ain't it?
And?
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
At what, exactly?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
You really want to know, sir?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
No, sir. Not at all.
You're dismissed, Private.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Sam the Man.
I hear they're closing that post down.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
A .45--
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
So?
That's not the point.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
They fought against the Indians?
They were in the Army. Like your father.
Tanks, huh?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
You lived in the States for a while?
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
You get much of that in here?
So.
That's right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Bledso
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Morning, Hollis.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Sam--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
That's me.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
Mom?
What's she singing about?
You got in late last night.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
We haven't talked since high school.
Field trip?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Nice-looking kid.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Couple months before I was born--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
The shooter local?
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Uh-huh.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Thirty-five bucks.
You ever been married?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Why?
That's Butterfield...
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Death.
I could scoop them out.
I'll tell you.
Anything?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
He's a secretive man.
And you don't ask questions?
You don't believe me.
I'm no bodyguard.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Stuff?
I told you --
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you all right?
Is it finished?
What were you doing up there?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Where the fuck is he?
You believe that?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Are you sure?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
I tried to pay you off.
D'Amour --
Not much.
The Puritan?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
For an introduction.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
No.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
You didn't try hard enough.
He did something with the ground.
Yes?
Call me tomorrow.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
One question.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Not true.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Oh.
Hi again, how's it going?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
No, its easy.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
Nice one.
Where's your husband?
Working.
Do you ever see him?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Mr. Harris?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Uh, no.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
I guess she's busy.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
How'd it go today?
Oh no...
Bad?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
You raised me, like a son.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Well I know he's come here before.
May I help you?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
I do.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
I had to.
We need to talk.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
What are you looking for exactly?
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
He was trying to tell me something.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
Thanks for handling this.
How're you doin' today?
Ah, Mom.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
So you're still breast-feeding?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Careful.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
No.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
They ever love you back?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
I was just playing ball.
Just not my type, I guess.
So...does it hurt?
Oh.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
So she's honest.
Hey.
You having fun?
None of your business.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
What'd it say?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
That was so weak.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Hey.
What's up?
he's just playing, Q...
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
When did you decide all this?
Yup.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
So why'd you give up ball?
You asked me what was missing.
I heard enough.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Better late than never, right?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Your door was unlocked.
I ain't a damn liar.
What do you want?
You smell like trouble --
Brain and Lung.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It was scary though.
Yeah, hey. Chad.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
uh...uh...What is it?
OPEN THE DOOR.
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
It's not -- what's a 422?
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
What's that stand for?
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
Well I don't go out very much.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Yeah, of course.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
It's ok.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
C'mon guys, settle down --
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
DAD --
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.

He's doing the interview with the lady --
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Do you have love in your heart?
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
....do you know who I am?
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?"

You see?
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Braces?
I don't know.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
...Lily...?
No.
Twelve.
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?

She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
No.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
-- let's talk more about your background --
I'm sorry.
Psychology major?
Do you have your masters?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
They wouldn't?
Kind of.
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah.
You can't just come in here.
Calm down.
There's no disturbance.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
I don't have to answer your questions.
I didn't do anything.
I don't know a loud crash.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
No.
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
I need you to get me Paula --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
What were you saying, Stanley?
I'm drinking.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
I love you so much.
I think that you know.
But you can't say....
Hello?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Linda --
mmmhmm.
Phone number.
818-753-0088.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
Alright.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
What is it, mother?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
How is he?
You can do it.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Where are you going?!
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
You can't do it.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
Thanks, but not for me.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Athos, please...!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Are you hungry?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Betrothed?  I think not.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
At least help Raoul.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Sire, I --
The food doesn't please you?
Captain Doyle?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah?
Bullshit...
I'll take the south end -
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
And he took a swing at you?
And what did he do to the girl?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Yeah?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Where up north?
No...
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
I killed them.
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
How about Marvosa and the others?
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
What about him?
What have we missed?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You said the guy down here is good.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
I'll pick you up in...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
That's narrow?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
It's getting late and...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
I'll take you.
You worked out well.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Francis? Where are you?
It's me.
No.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
I don't want to know.
Yes.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Absolutely,
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Yeah...
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
No.
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Tell me about yourself.
No.
Then why?
Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Lt. Fisk said...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
You went in the apartment?
She got all right?
Did you get my card?
No.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
And?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
You had disadvantages.
Pictures?
Yes. I'd considered it.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Fight what?
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why Memphis?
And all this will be for real?
Go away.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
You don't know the real me.
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
Hey Andy, good show.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
What is this, World War Two...?
I was very original!
Are you at peace with your family?
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
I saw Michael!
Where?
You're two hours late.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Don't be ridiculous.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Did you hear that?
He had an accident.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Morpheus...
Holy fucking shit!
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Did you believe in them too?
How is he?
I'm going to make the call.
That vase.
What?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
What does that mean?
Did you go to her?
Are you all right?
What happened?  What did you see?
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
What is it?
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
No one has ever done anything like this.
Do what?
Are you all right?
See who?
What do they want?
Why?
Neo!
Sounds good.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
I gotta get the stuff.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Look at her.
Nervous?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
Back so soon.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
How much?
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
What do they expect you to say?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
Charlie...?
Bore.
A paper on that one too?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
I'm sleepy.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Hey... you got stereo.
You could say that.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Dinner?  Again?
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
And you could care less --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
-- Black.
Who?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Do they, m'dear?
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Honey, please.
What about the Mayor?
...This shit's not bad.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
What are you eating.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Well... goodnight.
Thank you for coming.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
No, I don't --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
Mind if I throw up?
Whose?
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Are you?
I from dat nex' place.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Can't, sistah.
Yes.
Yah.
She knows you real self?
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Sure.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Jennifer.
You love Allison, don't you?
How did you meet?
You think so?  How do you know?
What are you doing here?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Susan?
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
How long have you been standing there?
Where are you going?
You first.
I love your smell.
...No.
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
Well -- I --
But there's so much to tell you --
What will we do?
I'm still here.
Joe, that's the kitchen.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
How are you?  How're you feeling?
It is a deal?
Bill --
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Make an exception?
I'm not everybody.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Are you sad, Bill?
I wouldn't put it that way.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Yes?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
So that's what love is?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Joe, don't do this --
I told you to shut up.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
You are --?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
I didn't ask any question.
What the hell are you talking about?
Yes what?
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
How did you know?
Uh oh --
So what's wrong with that?
That's all?
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
You know each other?
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
What was that?
I'm sorry --
How'd you know?
Not at all.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
30.
Hiya.
I'm sorry... um... ?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
That's right I did, didn't I?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
It's isolated.
Your wife?
Who?
And what did he say?
I'll go see him.
Yeah?
I told him about your car.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Don't protect him.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
Well, that's me.
You tell me.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
What's wrong with this one?
Teddy. Your buddy.
What do you mean "bad news"?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
I should kill you.							 *
What was it for?							   *
Doing...?
What's your twenty?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Make it 40%.
Make it 35.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
You do.
The Keys?
Died in childbirth, having me...
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Okay.  What's up?
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
C'mon, man!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
What's it say?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Define small.
This the load you lost a while back?
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Yeah?
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
You don't seem like no fag...
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Yeah, well, so?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Don't need a comb.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
These guys're good drivers.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Yessir, I can see that.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
... and taxi fare for me.
Tunnel?
What?
To what?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Where'd you get that limp?
The Hilton.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Would you recognize him again?
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
...are you with the Consulate?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Got a family back there?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
What they give you?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Okay?
Whose?
You know where it is?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
His name?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
And a right.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
What do you-?
What are you doing down here?
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
No...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
What?
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
I said that?
What about a bee...?
No, I haven't.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
That's nice.
What thing?
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You're still a writer.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Where?
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
What can we do' mate?
What if I pay the rent?
- right..where is it?
Where's the bloody -
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Hola..
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
You don't trust me.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Just like old times.
I managed.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
What did you think of him?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
She sacrificed herself..
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
That's S.O.P..
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
But why tell us?
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Talking's good, walking's better.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Who is "they?"
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Claire.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
I donít think so.
Yes.
No sir.
Certainly Ethan.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
What sector's the air conditioning?
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
What problem?
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
Youíre probably right.
You got it.
I knew about Jim.
Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Jack you're so wicked.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes...  Itís him.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thank you, Rose.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
You haven't said anything.
The guy died.
He got hit by a bus.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Here.
Why you looking around so much?
It's wrong to just let them go.
I'm going to marry him.
When you get engaged?
I'm a wolf?
Oh my God.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
Snap out of it!
What?
What are you talking about?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Thank you!
For what?
Awful?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
You're making me feel guilty again.
That's right.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Maybe you're right.
I shouldn't.
Yes?
On the floor?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
We should talk alone.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
No.
And we'll sell the house.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Oh.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Alright.
Don't fight.
I'm sure she did.
Sure!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Sorry. That was rude.
Why do men chase women?
You knew that man?
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
That's my house.
Oh.
You were a tiger last night.
Please!
You don't vote for kings.
NI!   NI!
Oh!
One that looks nice.
Oh, please!
You said it again!
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Had enough ... ?
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Hello.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Well, what are you then?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
What is your name?
Ni!
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
Well you could say: "Dennis"
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
... Well, we did do the nose.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
That's easy!
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
I can't.
Who's that then?
I think I could pull through, sir.
They cost fifty pounds each!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
I'm ... your son ...
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
We're coming with you.
Well ...
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
Back to your bed!  At once!
They're all saying the word ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
No, no, no.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
How about yourself?
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
She'll get over it.
What's this?
It's a diary.
Checked and locked, sir.
A situation?
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
It's the Queen's decision.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
It's so infernally cold in here.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
No.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
Aye, ma'am.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Yes, ma'am.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I was told you were in a fight.
Well, both.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Well?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
From whom?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
What's the riddle?
Dead?
How'd you know it was us?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Something's happened to them.
It's already out.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Put in a quarter.
You're not coming, Alex.
One.  In case...
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Go for it.
Yes...
What did you say?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Someone's shut off my money!
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
It's been a very strange day.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Sure.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
You're an understandin' fella.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Yes...what is it?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
I...
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
That's okay.
Are you okay?
Yes.
No, no, I'm fine.
Mulholland Drive?
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
Those men in front, in the car.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Betty Elms.
Go ahead.
Oh boy.
Find out who they are?
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Where are we ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
I'm working on it.
You took an awful big risk back there.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
I don't get it.
Do you know where you're going ?
What are you DOING here ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Where ?
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
But, he's...
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Of course.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
John, sir.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
What was that ?
We can't afford too many surprises.
Thank you very much.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Yes.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Why don't you shut up now.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Don't mention it.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Pommeroy.
Okay, no problem.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Can I see him?
I don't know if I want to.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
I'm glad you're here.
More than anything in the world.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
I know that.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Don't wake up Vada.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
He said it was a gift.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
WHAT??
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Boy, you're really into this.
This isn't just a mood ring.
My mother stood on this very spot.
What's he smoking?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
What's that?
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
This is it I guess.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Hi!
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Well I'm sort of involved.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
What do you mean?
Really?
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Oh, how do you mean?
No, why?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
I haven't danced in.....
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
What?
He was allergic to bees.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
In the garage.
Do you miss her?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Is that your camper?
She's shy.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
My ball, I lost my ball.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Uh huh, why?
I like my name.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Uh huh.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
What are you saving for?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Here.
Hi Vada.
He likes her better than me.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
Go figure you.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
The man you love.
Someday she'll thank you.
Zit cream?
Ben Gay.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
And loving him means loving all of this.
Let me rephrase that...
And the answer was so simple.
Jesus, we're trapped!
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
So... one almost has to...
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Is anybody watching?
I think he's been fired.
It doesn't say th...
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
No accents today.
Jules, what's wrong...
And to m...
What?
Is there food?
Barnett, please -
I said, I've been real tired.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
Who the hell is he?
You know better than that.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Yes, but we're just singing.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Come on. He's a crook.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
He's my father.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
What's this?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
You got a place to stay?
Wrecks.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
What year?
Does their hair fall out?
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Bye.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Tom. You remember?
I have to go.
I knew when I first met you.
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
It's me. What is it?
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Oh?
Do you study at all?
What?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He ain't really new.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Southern California.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You sure do it loud.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
That's what Tim said.
Yeah.
By all means, knock yourself out.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Lobotomy Bay?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
How is it?
Yours.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory.
That's indescribable.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Where's it parked?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Yeah baby.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Waitin' in the lounge.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Fill her up?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Where's Wilma?
They say your dad's 'round town.
People seen him 'round.
His profession?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Yeah, I been there.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
How about another beer?
They must work on the section gang.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
How come you stay 'round here?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Goin' to see my kid.
Four.
I can see why.
What's wrong?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
You heard me!
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
'Don't sound so sure.
Great.
That's right.
How you doin', boy?
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
How often does he get like that?
How often is that?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Well, I got married to one of them.
I know.
Shut up, Will.
Now you stay put!
What's the matter now?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Since when?
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Take this off.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
You're hurt...
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Dixie McCoy
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
What's this?
An odd selection, Mr Case.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Jah guides us.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Right...
Yo.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
We got problems topside.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Wait... You hear that?
Want to fucking answer them?
I thought you already left.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Why would you want me to kill you?
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
How long have I been out?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Thanks.
Petty good.
YOU DID.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Yeah.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Anita!
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A flack jacket.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Oh.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Is that true?
Better than I...
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I love the way she writes.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Do you think you'll find her?
Well, are you here with anybody?
Please. Please don't walk away.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Yes.
What?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
By name.
Not at all!
He sure is big, Jack...
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
Where are you going?
Oh, please...
Come back here!
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
You mean a shithead.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
So, you feeling anything?
What is it?
'Morning.
Jess?
Huh?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
I'm sure you would.
Girl, what are you doing?
Watching TV.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
It's over.  It's over.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
With Hypnocyl?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Remember -- open mind.
Take us there, Kristen.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
What are you talking about?
How is he?
What did you think?
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I won't allow it.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
I'm an actress.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Coffee?
Really, no.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Let's go in.
What did you say?
So who left who?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
Eleven.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Oh please sod off.
I don't know what happened.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
That's right.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
What?
Shame!
What happened?
What's your name?
Well, fire away.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
No, it doesn't.
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Right.  No one else?
What?
Yes.
No -- you're right.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Y-y-y-yes...
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Oh, I had them removed.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Thank you, ma'am.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
What is it, kid?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Yeah...
Let's go, for Christsakes...
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
They went that way.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
He can't hear you!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
No!
You can come back later!
Don't you have any clubs?
Just wait till you hear...
What's this?
Right!
Is that so?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
When?
Time out!
'Kay, Mac!
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Because I quit breathing.
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Yeah!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
After you, ma'am.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
What?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Were they pen pals?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Let's find a telephone.
We found each other, didn't we?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Congratulations.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Amazing.
Who's this?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Why are you asking me this?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What?
So it wasn't real.
Hi, Peter.
Oh.  That's nice.
Well, good.  Good for you.
What?
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
I'm sorry.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Very funny.
Hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't have an Amana freezer.
What's he do?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Kate, is something the matter?
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Now what do we do?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Her brother.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Like a detective.
What about Peter?...
He's a jerk.
Yes.  He is.
So...
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Well, where are they?
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
That's right... .
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Man, you were a mess!
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
The Golden Warriors.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
Listen, you like beer?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
What are you crying for?
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
I just told the Father.
My hand.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
You are like—
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
What did you say?
You still call it ratting?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Raise a hand to me and... .
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Take it easy now, Terry.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I am--It's our only chance.
What can we do against them?
But they are not yet one of us.
A symbol, Master.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Your pleasures of course!
You better hope there is.
Then why do you shake so?
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
No. No! No!
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
And the one driving the other car?
Oh, is this Adele?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Did you know that when you married him?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Outside of that.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You know how I felt about her.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
You get the key?
You're gonna use a ram?
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
So you've done this before, huh?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
You comfy?
Boy, it stunk in there.
That's funny.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Nothing.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You believe that?
Where?
You were going to see her?
Why are you mad?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Weren't you expecting us?
How many?
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
You gonna write me a check?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I were you, I'd get up and run.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
The <u>ninth</u>?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
It's a guy you know.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
I can tell.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
What do you want?
Was a she, name Tuffy.
It's a --
Thanks, Dad.
He's about to.
You were talking in your sleep.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
So?
Out for the evening?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
...the fuck is this...
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Then why are you looking for her?
Waitress!  Four beers!
We gotta face some facts here.
How come you're not pukin'?
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Get me into a plane!
No.  You're trying to beat me.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Thank you, 'Mam.
You take care, Dorie.
Danny's not coming?
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
How did you?...
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Fook ya!
Let's go.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
How do you like my hair?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Carol!
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
I don't get it.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
What's the matter?
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Peggy Sue!
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Charlie! Am I dead?
I call this the staccato. 
Want me to drive you home later?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Is this slow enough for you?
He's trying.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Charlie. About last nights..
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
What're you doing here?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What?
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Oh, God, Dion.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
What are you shooting for?
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Yes.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
I have a note.
What about?
What does Charlie think about that?
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
What a great kite.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
How, did you know about my grandfather?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
I came to say goodbye.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Is something wrong?
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Who was that?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Is this a good spot?
Why not?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Don't apologize for me.
We're not skipping this treatment.
I'm not going to close the--
I'm not going to die.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Innocuous?
Client of yours?
Continue.
I buy that.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
One more thing, Your Honor...
What do you want?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Except... you were gay?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
Do you need a break?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Yes.
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
Right.
Get real.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
I might.
What kind of people?
Great.
Aren't you?
Probably since she was born.
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
That's perfectly clear.
Yes, we did.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
He was doing a great job.
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Bring the light!
'Mean the whispers?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
They're coming.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
Just give me your hand.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
What do my eyes see?
Like the light is scalding it.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Can we switch?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
So now you know.
What?
He used that?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
I never said I was.
Smoke screen for what?
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
What're you doin'?
Suleiman!
New Mecca....
"God is Great," yes?
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
As you wish.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Where does the river lead?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Look -- she remembers.
The blood transfusion.
You didn't think so then.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
But how long is a day?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Objection!
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
He's trying to form words.
Gone.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
No cigar.
Lucius.
I told you not to bring the other one.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Read it yourself.
No.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Then you admit --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
I don't know.
What is your proposal?
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Yes.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
But the proof? The doll?
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
So what's the problem?
Says he can't walk.
Fuck you bitch.
...beautiful night.
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
Must be somebody?
...there's nobody.
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Merle?
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
I didn't like it.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
I'm supposing.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
Would you mind?
I think I'd like to dance.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
I didn't say anything.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
Nice of him.
Certainly not to me.
I didn't notice him.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
Nothing matters.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
They're going to arrest me.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Do you have to leave the note?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
In a way.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Do you think I was faking?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
We try to be decent.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
To do what?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Private eye?
Why not here?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
How's life treating you?
Time for a little chat?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
Information.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Recently, then.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
So it seems Sergeant.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Such as?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Ye have, have ye?
But you still think she's innocent.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
You already have the checks, darling.
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Thank you.
Terrific.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
Might?
In your car
Shall we have a drink or something?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Now, top secret file.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Fuck off.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Hello.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
You'd look naked without one.
Promise?
Ah, Susy, it...
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
They don't go for the vault?
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
They're on their way to Maui.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
This gonna take long?
Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What are you talking about?
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
No way, old buddy.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
What, Sergeant?
You're looking well, Dutch.
I like your hat.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
It's... it's not like that.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
That's ridiculous.
For an hour.
Three hundred.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
I'm sorry.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
I think it's exciting.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Where are you taking me!?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
What do you mean?
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
What's up, where you going?
Cynthia's not coming?
Oh, god, what?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Why do you want to know?
You're being ridiculous.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Kit...
Vivian.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
But what if they serve soup?
Miss Vivian --
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
May I help you?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Do you remember me?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
But what if something happens to you?
But how can you be sure?
We'll never survive.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
You're quick.
Why is that, do you think?
What do I do?
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
What is it?
-hold it, hold it-
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
What?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Do you want me to go on with this?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It won't be easy, Sire.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
Could this be a trap?
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Go in, get after her!
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Think it'll work?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
But that's cheating!
Help!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
What do you mean?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
By the sacred memory...
Nietzche...
The Blue Max...
Heil you know who!
What did you tell the people?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
No.
How do you know she didn't make a call?
And when she left, she never came back.
Not at all!
What's your interest?
I don't know.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Were there any calls?
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Please!
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Here?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
In a hurry.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Who's he?
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Huh?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
What makes you sound so certain?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I can come down next week.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
You eat like a bird.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Why?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Shut up!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
...Forty thousand dollars!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Thousands?
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
That spoke to you?
Your father?
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You would.
I think so.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
Thank you.
But it was really my fault.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
We'll grant that.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Cry-baby?
I see. Was that all she said?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Is that a fact?
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
Shall we unpack it?
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
What was her name?
Why am I doing this?
They're filthy, Mother.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
What is it, Rose?
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Don't mention it.
But Rose...
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
I don't know.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
She's getting herself up to go out.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
He kissed her.
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Are they polar bears, too?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
I think we both know her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
What time is it?
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Yes, sir.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Yes, I am.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Yes, Ma'am.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
How much?
And... ?
What and?  That's what I got.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
We should slow down.
I'm just saying...
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
They... they shot me.
Where we going?
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
No.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
He went to pick up lunch.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Pure horse.
Yeah... great.
Alright?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Just got here.
What the hell's his problem?
The gang's all here!
It's one of a kind.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
They are clear, my Master.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Someone who loves you.
What's going on?
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
What are you telling them?
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Good shot, Red Two.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
What do you remember?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
He might be.  I don't know.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
What a guy
Was all I had to say
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Are you - giving a party?
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
I think he might be worried.
It's okay.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I should leave.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
'Bout seven.
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Don't say that.
My side.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
No dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Few minutes?
Six!
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Black market?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Stuff it, man!
I won't.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Did ya win?
Spider Rice.
Freak luck for sure.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
It ain't your locker no more.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
...What kinda dog is this again?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Ice skate.
Why?
What?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
You serve martinis, doncha?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Shoulda guessed.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
What was <u>that</u>?
What's that comin' from the bar?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
What the hell's a freeway?
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
How did you get onto Doom?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Hold on a second.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Romeo! Romeo!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
I'll not endure him.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
That dreamers often lie.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
A Plague o' both your houses.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
So where do you go from here?
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Lose them!
About time!
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Now, what did we steal?
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Bad company...
Where's my information?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
So what do we do?
Don't cross me...
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly.
How did you know?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
I didn't expect that he would.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
What a surprise...
He says this is their block.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What'd you say to him?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
So is the woman.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I needed to know.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Very ugly.
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
What the fuck happened?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Closest and oldest.
Let's get him out of here...
Why's that?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
What the hell happened here?
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
What the hell...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
What are you gonna do?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
How long is it going to take?!
It's gonna be o.k.
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
That's right.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Dwayne's dead.
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
I'm all ears.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
None of us like it!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
What for?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Nothing.
OK.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
He's not, he's...
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
And I'd take it out on him.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
I don't know.  My friends...
Yeah, I've seen him.
Test the product?
Why?
Sheriff Hogan --
Dwayne.
Lingerie...
She's not his type.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
You're never getting that much.
How's work?
And what happened?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
The band has been playing over an hour.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
So tell me what you know.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
I'm busy at the moment.
You bring American money?
No.  It's my first time.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
I knew you were lying.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
How you doin'?
What's wrong?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
It sounds impossible --
Why LA?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Who?
She's getting undressed.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
It's your turn!
I wouldn't do that!!!
Shhh, my head hurts.
How was the sex?
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Dancing?
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
What is this?
First class.
I need your help.
Why don't you go get them?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Do you still have the bills?
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
What is your name?
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Sir, I can explain.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
No.
A little.
I know a shortcut.
Don't go there...
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Yes, I think so.
Excuse me?
What?!
This concrete?  This is still America.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
I could get promoted right out of here.
They put you in charge?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Shut up!
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
I'm not running.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
"Sink the putt."
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.
In vino veritas.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Of course we are.  Of course.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Everest.  Is that right?
Give me that!
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Five hundred.
I think so.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Lost!
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
You were not.
Reporter?
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
He's got a houseboat.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
-- who's married to --
I love you.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Even when you were young?
Walter, I'd love to --
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
-- it was a betrayal.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It's a sign --
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, I know that part --
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
Destiny takes a hand.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Magic.  It was magic.
Mom, we already...
Hello.
It's me?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
Who is this?
It's not that late in Seattle.
No.
Why not?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
It's a spice rack.
Not.
What?!
P.  Dad?
Sure.  Looking good.
How did they get our phone number?
-- a slice of pizza --
I don't know.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Get out.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Hi.  Sam?
It's a little derivative.
You did?
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
I read an article about this ...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
No thanks.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
A fighter, huh?
What makes you so sure?
Over my dead body.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
You weren't waiting for me.
Tell me.
When?
Like what?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
But honey ...
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
What can I do for you?
Now that's down-right insulting.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Leave me out of this.
Nothing.
Why don't you call the cops?
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Is that how you play?
How much time do you have?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
It's me.
What is it?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
How the hell did we get this detail?
Twelve
You on a roll?
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Fuuuuuck
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Sure, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy.
Okay
No, I'm good.
Why do you say that?
What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.
Cool it. We got business.
I've got a hot one.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
I thought you'd be happy.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Turns out he's connected.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Find a chaplain.
Yes, sir.
But, sir...I...I...
You must be a hell a shot.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
Last I knew.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Where?
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
GO!
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
You get a translator, Captain?
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
How about I go right, sir?
Vecchio.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
What deal?
Goddamn it!
This evening is over.
Lloyd?
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
No, no, don't go in there.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I don't feel anything.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Visit her at the home.
What?
I just had a phone call.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Lloyd?
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Do you love him?
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
That's right, work it out.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Hi.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yeah.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Busy?
So you're monumentally busy?
Actually, I think that I...
Well...
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Job?  Being a great date.
I think you should wear that.
Me?  Sure I do.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
Yeah.  With potential.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
No.
You're shaking.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
We'll see.
You told your dad?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
I'm fine.
Okay.
How's it going?
You're freaking out here man.
The truck?
Fine Lloyd.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Oh boy.
I was gonna...
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
What?
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
He's important to my business.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
How you feeling, all right?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Pistols?
So I'll talk to him about it.
Are you losing money?
Eight hundred, give or take.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
Outside.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Yes.
That's too bad.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
What's your subject?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Oh--a God complex
You're getting obvious.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
I got a surprise for you.
Don't do this.
The young girl is slashed again.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
But...
I get scared really easy, okay.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What are you talking about?
What was that?
What do you want?
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
More of a game really.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
What?!
Where are you?
Nope.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Jesus Gale what happened?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Hmm.
What did you know about your mother?
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Thank you.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Sidney, what happened?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Basements creep me out.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
It is in my script.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Where?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
Do I?
Hello.
Hello.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't know.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Why do you want to know my name?
I told you not to hang up on me.
You getting scared?
Listen, asshole...
I'm getting scared.
Michael... Michael Myers.
NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I was first to respond.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Jesus...
What's the delay?
How's the book?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
I saw him leaving wearing it.
And why would she do that?
Can you see me right now?
I heard screaming.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Stop. Right there.
I thought everything was checked out.
There goes my chance with Sid.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Are you serious?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Why are you doing this?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
It's past seven.
No way.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
Where was the girl?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
I don't believe it.
What the fuck is going on?
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
What?
Is there any blood in it?
I read.  Remember reading?
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Did you read them?
No witnesses of any kind?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Does this make it with you?
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
How did the fire fight end?
It is Victor.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
It was him.
Then, he must write about these murders.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
What is it?
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Don't do this... please...
This painting...
It surprises me.  It really does.
I don't know, with this case.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Let's get along...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Another one, eh?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
Talk!
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
He just couldn't wait...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Not no more.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
She'd be about thirteen now...
But couldn't you...?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
I mean the armchair!
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Martin, what-
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
But what is the truth?
And that is?
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
You are a gentleman.
Follow that boat!
You have the last act?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Never!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Most interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
How long has it been?
And your relations?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Where is the play?
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
What piece? Richard Crookback?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Who wrote that?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
I feel a scene coming on.
Kit
Good title.
Two hours at prayer!
Not ready? Where is she?
God bless you!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
But the plague
A lowly player.
You can bring them with a word.
You would not leave me?
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Mr. Henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
That's my line!
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
No…no.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Do you understand me?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Is there a man?
A theatre poet?
Will you shut up and play.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
He's still here.
Is this necessary?
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
I don't know.
Nothing.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Well?
Are you recording it?
Take another look at these two.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Cameron.
Cameron?
Aroused and inflamed.
Hugo.
He's got a car?
What sort of car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
You want me to kick it open?
Did what?
I'm just looking.
What?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Oh, good.
Forget it.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
Alex.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
I see.
What about?
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Is this where no one stays?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
That's what it cost, David.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
It wasn't like that.
Here.
I'm not sure --
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Hello.
It was some guy called Brian.
The human condition.
I write about it?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Yes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Don't you like her?
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe... why do you ask?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
I don't know.
Wow.
You're late, George.
I gotta talk to you.
But you don't know what happened.
What?
George --
Is she all right?
I hope she's all right.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Oh, no.
Want me to?
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Yeah.
Why?
I am not like my mother!
Great.
Right, that's right.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
How long you had this?
I'd cut it...
Did Lester know about him?
George...
George... how about Felicia?
Yeah?
I know... you don't know, I know.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- what?
You don't think so? I do.
-- where'd you go?
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
No --
Well then what are you trying to do-
No, man.
What?
Wash her.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
-- took a bus.
Not yet.
Call me!
Here in the canyon.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
Who?
Now, George --
But in the same house, you know, one house.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
What!
Hey, baby, what's happening?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Whether or not I'm going.
What do you want?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
I just want to know, that's all.
-- please, baby --
Yes, yes, I did.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
But what?
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Now wait a minute...
I wanna hear about it.
No thanks.
What about Jackie?
Lester, it just happened.
All right, who're you with? Jill?

A soap?
Well maybe I can get you something.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
Here.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
-- you phony asshole --
Poster-Kleiser.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
But you have problems?
It's been so long I don't how long?
I would say so, yes.
-- Yesss?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
No... how long did you say?
No.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
I don't know.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah, I guess so.
All right.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Yes?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Mommy!
And, er... where are they now?
No.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Beg pardon?
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Hi, babe.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Mr. Ullman?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
I'd better collect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
What?
I don't get you.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
What? 
Good evening, Vincent.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Two days.  An hour or so.
That machine.
I know.  It's ancient.
Hurry, Sister!
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Babies
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
We need experience.
Experience!  Right?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Are you leaving us?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
You mean black people?
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
My what?
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
But... wait a minute...
I must go where I can be of use.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
And if I don't?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Really?  Lieutenant?
What're you doing?
Who are you guys?
We didn't tell you what?
It's a bluff, Vince.
I can't see anything in here!
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
Yes?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
I don't understand.  Where is she?
We both missed.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
What the hell are you doing?
Excuse me?
Stains of blood.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Hmm?  See them?
Maybe you should take this.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
I'm sure I don't know.
Out there.  What do you see?
No, I couldn't...
I hear nothing.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
I insist that you have it.
People have put their trust in you.
To avenge his father, and the others.
What?
It was you there?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Katrina...
Quickly, close it.
Use caution.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
May I see my mother?
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
Well, I guess it's all good.
French-fried potaters.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Please Doyle, don't.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Stop it, Doyle!
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
I want to be baptized.
But maybe just for awhile --
What are all them books?
Yeah.
You told me to come by.
How did your mama die?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Why did he do that, reckon.
I thought they was.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
I like the way you talk.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
Yeah.
What you readin'?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
Yeah.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I ain't got no boy.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yeah.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I've heard it said that way.
Oh. How about before that?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
He just got out of the state hospital.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
Is he leaving right this minute?
I didn't mean that.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Like me, too.
Will that be cash or charge?
And your father? Is he from New York?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Are you closed?
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I've never seen anything like it.
Slow down, huh?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Two, right?
Uh, better make it one.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
It's all yours, baby.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Lovely.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
What is this, some kind of joke?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
What does that mean?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What can I do for you?
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
I mean breakfast.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Yeah, that's right.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
His only copy?
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
How do you want that cooked?
That's obvious.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
How long you have this detail?
You mean, early morning the 16th?
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Still lashed to the mast.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Cigarette?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
Does it now?
It is.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
And her farmhouse...?
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Can I say something, here?
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Wanna see my driver's license?
What did he say?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
We're not?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Men?
What happened?
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
OH!
We'll take a rain check.
Interesting.
What did you say?
I'm fine.
I may spill something.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
I guess she's not in here.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
How did those holes get there?
Personally, I'm Type O.
I'm not surprised.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Bull fiddle.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
You must be quite a girl.
Wanna bet?
Why?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
You're leading again.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
And you'll be in all evening?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
We'll take it!
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Where did he conduct?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Rough?
You can't trust those guys.
What's in Florida?
Glasses?
Why?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
What theory?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Would you mind moving along, please?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Where's your shell collection?
You mean you can't fall in love?
I don't want to bore you.
Me?
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
You know what I love about all this?
Or Kat....
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
I had to say something to get you here.
You heading to the train station?
What’s his problem?
Hey.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
It’s cute.
This happened to you?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
I guess so.
Is this for last night?
What?
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Hi.
I should go.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You didn’t have to do that.
You knew?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
So why’d you let him go?
“Not yet...”
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
What is it you do again?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Sometime, but not like this.
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
Colored.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
But, Charlie --
David Lee...
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Where was you, Daddy?
You bet we is!
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
What's that, son?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
You got two shirts on?
Did you see Daddy?
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
No mam -- I looked all over.
Can't sleep?
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
It's the heat.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Well, let me have it.
How's the weather out there?
What did he want?
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Will they give him a trial?
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Pillow.
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Kyle?!
I don't know.
Hello there, children!!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
MOM!!!
Uhh... I don't know.
SHIT!
It's so very cold...
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Oh, brother.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
Huh?
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
But I-
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
Hello, Conan!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
And ze rope?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Getting drunk is no solution.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Magnificent, magnificent.
Of course, of course...
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
On channel 10?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
You're certain of that?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
What are we going to do?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
You're ready for the real thing?
Oh my God.  What happened?
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Take this flare.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
Hopefully sooner than later.
What do you mean?  What happened!
I'm going back for Taylor!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
What kind of man?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
Can I get you something for the road?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
What about bowling?
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
Son?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Who's there!
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Like this?
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Well, that was plan A.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Zip.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
You got any broken bones?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't tell you, Theo.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
Very professional.
I'm not here to bowl.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Tell your little pal to let go.
Very good, busyboy.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Who identified the body?
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Thirty yards.
Where is it?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
How deep is he?
Then why am I here?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
You don't want to know.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Yes, sir.
They've left, keep watching!
You don't know that.
A half a mile long?
Did you hear me, sir, because --
To what?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Beth --
Norman.
What are they?
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
You did, didn't you?
It's not worth the risk.
Why should I go?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You don't trust me?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Squids?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
It's for motion sickness.
Ulcers.
He can't manifest.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
C'mon -- what?
But --
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth?
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
What is that?  What are you doing?
Beth --
For who?  The fish?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Where's it coming from?
How are you feeling, Norman?
This answers one of our questions.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Norman, where are you?
What happened to her?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Hold on.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
No, they didn't say --
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Huh?
Squint harder.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
What?
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
How much do you think she's talking about?
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
What do you mean?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
You don't believe in the Force?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
I think she's going to be all right.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
I read you sir.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Did you read her mind ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
You always told me you couldn't do human...
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Profile's wrong... there.
WHERE IS IT ?
I don't know, Zander.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
I can't help it.
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
What's wrong with you ?
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Where'd it come from ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
...CUT OFF !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Well, yeah, sure...
Hi, mom.
Best in the Fleet !
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
What is your position ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yes, sir...
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
You saved the ship.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Nope.
The people in New Hampshire.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Why?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Goodbye.
I live there.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...such a pleasant sound.
You're still here.
I <u>can</u>?
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
No, I don't...
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Then I'll come back, then.
I used to go out with a politician.
What's the scene...
It used to be the Old Mill.
What?
Is it...
Gosh, you look nice.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
What, what what are you doing here?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Waterford, Vermont.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
I've always seen that.
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
I wasn't in the car.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
You have no right to...
She's absolutely r...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
But not that <u>way</u>...
Will you help me out...?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
What...?
I know that...
Wally...
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
I'll put the, in your r...
-- she's got 'religion.'
Doug, the traffic light...
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
He told you that...
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
For what cause?
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
I didn't say anything to them.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
What's in all the bags?
<u>Stop</u>...
I don't got the money.
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
Do something.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Yes, I hear it.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
Mass hysteria.
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
I hope it's the right kind.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
You lost Ben?!
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Why don't you say hello?
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
I'm fine, ba...
So you're okay.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Our children.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
WE are over.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
We don't have any coffee.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
I'm sorry, I just...
Jackie?
Look, you've never liked me...
Nobody likes a snoop.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
How the hell would you know?
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
You're a cross-dresser.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Not yet.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
What a great surpri...
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Where you goin'?
Don't ever say that.
Out! Leave the table!
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
It was God's will.
I'm always working.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
I know!
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Yes, Mikey?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Ready for tomorrow?
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Get the hell outta here!
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
One in a million recover.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hi, Dad!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
You're not.
You have beautiful skin.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's over there.
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Again!!
Great!
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah.
Eight, six, and four.
I know.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Prnceton.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Is he with the girl?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
How well do you know this place?
Who's Ryan Cooper?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
How goes the roll call?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Dissent?
Just what the hell is he talking about?
What does that mean?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Yes?
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Go back to sleep, baby.
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
What kind of trouble?
General Schmuck?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Suppose that were the case?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
And you'd like to see that?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
What the hell is Plan-R?
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Yes?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
What?
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Shoot, Lothar.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Primary circuit is live.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
He's dead.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Recall what mistake?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
I'm okay.  What's up?
But I get a red light.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
But who would be chosen?
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Yeah!
Typical male.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
What's it about?
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Any gunshot victims?
Don't let 'em fight.
That's the rock star thing.
A long, long, long...
Go!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Hey, you know me.
No, no.
I know, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
So, how was the ride, kids?
In what way?
I can come visit?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Glad it's okay.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
No, but I heard it was great.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
You okay, man? You okay?
He is.
He is.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Really?
You cut off your little finger?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Erica.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Jeff! Come up here!
What?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Yeah.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
And?
So what do you wanna do?
Mm-mm.
No, no.
Yes, you do.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Where are you going?
I've run out of words.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Do your covers and all that shit.
'Bye, Jeff.
You really suck, you know that?
Yeah.
Yeah, they could be songs.
For a while.
What?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I don't know.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
No, this has everything to do with you.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
You know, my mom has this saying.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Oh, How'd she get back?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
If you hit me...
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Could you give me a ride?
I'm going out later.
What?!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Cleo!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Hello?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
You're kidding.
Or, I could get my own horse...
Really...
Bank branch!
What the hell do you want?
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Roll 'em.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
What's wrong with it?
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
You bet.
Whose?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
If you love me, Joe.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
What assistant?
Or shall I call my servant?
You're a writer, you said.
Are you or aren't you?
Who else ?
I wrote that with my heart.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I don't know.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
They've come for my car.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
How about some evening clothes?
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Who?
A little.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
Whose room was this?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Haven't got a thing.
No?
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Paramount studios.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
I think I'd better keep it.
Home?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
We have to have a long talk about all this.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Hmmm?
A passionfruit smoothee.
Oh no, not you again.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You vicious--
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Guess! Go on.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I don't understand.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
I'd rather not talk about it.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Why is he acting so strangely?
No, MR. Danvers.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
That was meant for me!
I was on Earth...
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Then teach me how.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
What are you talkin' about?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You're welcome...??
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
I just can't stand this.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Yeah.
Nope, but --
Thirty-five.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
We've already got some.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
We gonna crash?
Who's the other woman?
I didn't have my camera with me.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I thought you'd never get here.
Lots of things...
It could make weather!
Today coffee----
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Where did it come from?
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
Yes! This time we got it right!
Lois, what are you doing?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I do?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
I want to.
Let's go to my place.
Hi.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
You do?
Gee. But --
What else is ballast for?
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Where?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Look, they need a machine to fly.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
I'm not so sure you do.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Impossible? Why?
Awesome!
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Is he for real?
An angle?
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
He's . . . cold. . .
This wasn't in the plan.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Albert!
I've been on the job.
Mom...
Do you know where you're headed?
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Not...gray.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
What are you doing here?
Besides that.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
This??
What do you suggest, my dear?
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
What're you writing, Lois?
Two.
What's your name, boy?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
I guess I got carried away
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Right on the first guess.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
There.
I broke the man out of prison --
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
They'll soon be over.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I...don't think so.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
So what brings you out tonight?
It does concern me.
C'mon, you know that won't...
Have you been waiting long?
A while.
Good night, Billy.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
That's right.
Why would he be frightened?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Isn't it a lovely day?
It's interesting.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
The people in the town?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
When?
Tell me about the Ottos.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
DADDY!!!
Yes.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Before the actual accident?
That was great.
You mean it?
How do you like it, Nicole?
Very slick.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Are you sleeping?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
She'll move away.
Is "he" inside?
See my mother?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
No, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Sidney is a liar!
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
I don't?
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Talk to her, Sidney...
Bribing me again?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
In his apartment -
This sort of thing!
But...
That's no way to talk...
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Like you?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I didn't do anything!
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Why did you call me?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You going to work all day?
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Do you know about the chip?
No one must follow your work.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Why?
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I'm sorry, John.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
I have detailed files.
I must be destroyed.
Are you afraid?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Where do you stand on all this?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
Yes.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Yeah.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Did you call someone you knew?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
Who warned you?
I wish to say something.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Von der Null?
Yes, I know who he is.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I have illegitimate children.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I don't understand what you mean.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Do you know what that is?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
Helmuth.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
So, you never heard of him.
Like this bandleader.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
You're a big help.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Freezing.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Hot dogs?
I want it to be over for you.
A girl.  You know.
I don't think I like this.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Why?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Why were the other two women killed?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Here's her driver's license.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
I could fight you on this.
Are you finished?
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Oh, God... !
This can't be real...
A game?
Why not?
Please...
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
What exactly do you do?
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Seriously?  What did they say?
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
Is this you?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
You?
That's a lie...
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
They won't...
What the fuck are you... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
No...
Stop it!
I have to show you...
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
About me?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
For you.
Why?
Fun?
But, will you?
I'm going to call.
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Who?
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
Physical?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
No.
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
How concerned should I be?
I only saw Theo drive up.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Why?
You're not telling us something.
All night?
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
I, I just can't...
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
What did it smell like?
Why?
I don't know.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
This is where we're going?
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Mrs. Dudley.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
David.
Is it over?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
I'm sorry.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
No.
Our black friends?
You should have let me do the talking.
Yeah?
Man knows what he likes.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Did Jenny know?
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Uh-huh.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
How d'you mean?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Now who's being sarcastic?
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Footloose and fancy free.
Nah, accommodation address.
-- Your employer?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Why not.
You don't seem bothered.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Fancy it?
What's in Big Sur?
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
All of what?
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Five thousand.
I don't know.
So what.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Are you finished?
Who's looking for you?
What.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
He didn't say that.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
No. I--tell me--
And how do we share--
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
Right! Strictly business.
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
...Huh?
Rye.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Dave.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Coffee, Ed?
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
This hair.
You don't got a headache?
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Uh-huh.
I don't understand.
...You're Ed Crane?
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Fifteen... what's next?
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Whose footprints?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
What is it?
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
I'm coming with you.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
You were going to be married.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
I think... it means it's full.
We have to try and draw it off!
We're not going to make the storage room!
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
What music?
--a dead one at that.
A window onto the human condition?
Certainly a nomination.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Sure she would.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
You think so?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
What's the hurry?
Oh, my God!
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
It looks so small.
I'll try.
When you get to Fiji?
The whole area's being evacuated.
They're coming.  Any minute.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
This man's still alive.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Who?
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Have you examined them?
How's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Where are you, Scully?
You're looking for a bomb.
...thirteen fifty six...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
No.
What did you find?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
This looks like new grass to you?
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
I have. I did. It's done.
What? What happened?
We've got to keep moving.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
Let me out. Stop the car.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
Did we go sailing?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I do it all the time!
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What's wrong?
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Do you think that's funny?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
I did, yeah.
Evil.
What difference does it make...?
Where the hell are we?
You sure about this?
I need you to find something in the basement...
She changed the codes.
Any psychiatric medication?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
Give her some cigarettes.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Tell me about him.
...to steal my girl.
...and buried him.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
I'm going back home.
A parrot...Let it go.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
...is there?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
That's his headache.
Thank you.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
Where's Harry?
I don't know.
Where?
How will I know you?
Martins.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Get the next plane.
So would I.
...in the morning.
A girl of spirit.
I said you win.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
You do!
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Zane Grey.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Coffee.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Are you mad?
Thank you.
In great pain?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Funny?
...Mr. Martins?
I'm Daffy.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Traveler.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
I'm sorry.
One kilometer
Hi.
So from there to there?
No.
Incredible.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
No one follows that midrash.
They only kill them when they love them?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
That's a movie, you moron.
Disease? What disease?
Is he a Nazi?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
No.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Why should I submit?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Who's Eichmann?
Why are you taking that?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Of course they're Jews.
Give me a reason not to.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Which was his room?
Which one were you aiming at?
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
That's all we've got left.
Oh, what is this shit?
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Where?
And what did you do?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Where do you think you're going?
Howard Stern.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Eat shit....
Yes.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Johana, am I boring you?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
Congratulations, Enzo.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
How do you know that?
Dollars.
Then tell him to wax it too.
What about the shoes?
Noireuter.
And where did you say you were from?
And... does the voice come back?
Yes, I know.
What room have you got?
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
It's okay.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
... Everything.
Everything about what?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
Anybody can have a bad day!
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Thank you...
I got fired.
So have I.  ... Hello?
No... tell me.
Promise me one thing.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Again?
Well?
Way past it.
No.  I'm just depressed.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
But... how is he going to breathe?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
What do you want me to do?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Yes Esther.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Mom! We're eating!
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You okay?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
What about me?
Then what do you do?
I don't know.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Where's that man?
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Well, I'd best be off.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Why did you give up teaching?
That was unfortunate.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Paul Lamont...?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
The company. We all work for the company.
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Should I?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
I hope it’s not too significant.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
What is it?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
I’m sorry...
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
Cinq cents.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Then why don’t you reach him?
Three...
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Are they still operative?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
What do you mean?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
No, but...
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
But that was her order!
Why?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Really?
What did it tell you?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
5,000 gold crowns.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
I know...
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Do you know how to count?
But my voices... they promised me...
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... I thought...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Why were you yelling like that?!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
"Love your enemies"...
You think you are ready now?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Only God knows the answer to that.
A beauty. Who is she?
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Really?
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Boys, boys...
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
But I want to help, I want to.
Wladek! How are you?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
What's all that gunfire?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Ohh the tag is broken.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I worry for you.
You don't want to learn.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
He chopped it off
What's in here then, lead?
Mama.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
I thought you blew all your money.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
Mottola.
They're still looking for him.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
What do ya mean?
And?
Did he say he wouldn't?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
See ya and raise three.
The name is Lonnegan.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
But what about all these other people?
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
What do you mean?
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
No.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
We missed him.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
For fifteen years.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're high enough.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Come on in.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Forgive me.  How are you?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
And he still wants to marry me!
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Yes.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
I never saw him before.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Get anything?
You mean that body-----?
When was that?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Goodbye.
That's ridiculous.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
What bonds?
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
My wife.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
They'll want more than your word for that.
You did... where?
I didn't knock Julia off.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
What's that?
What am I?  The fall guy?
Much better, thanks.
What hit me?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Someone get a doctor.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You bet I wouldn't.
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Bonds, sir?
Home!
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
We've got rope?
Ready?
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Where'd they go?
Missile!
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
Get off him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Just keep quiet.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Invest it.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
We're going to be right over here.
You're going to be fine.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Must be a compartment.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
We should head Northeast.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
We'll find our way.
No.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Can't you--
What do you make of them?
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
He's not slowing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
People are suffering.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Yeah.  So?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
At-at-at-at-at.
If there's gold.  If!
Iraqis.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
Epps...
What the hell are you doing!?
Control ON.
You know I don't feel well.
Don't go.
Then why did you bring it up?
Look, food!
Don't take anything.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
What are you doing?
You don't know.  You don't....
Are you all right?
no...no, no.
I thought you were through with it!
What's going on....what are you doing?
Which way?
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
That's not it.
Where's LUH?
Just look at all those people.
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Aren't you on suspension?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
How long were you hooked?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
What... ?
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Alex-
Why are we stopping here?
Prints?
How're you guys doing?
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
Reilly, Vice. I-
Device.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
It's our only option.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
No.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
But not now.
What is it?
Just as you say, Doctor.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
I would like to.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Gaston Monescu.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Lily, you must listen to me.
Then you go into the foyer.
I remember.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Naturally I did.
What's wrong now?
Make it out to cash!
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
It's disgraceful!
Um-hum ...
Then a little nap--
Crimson!
Correct!  Good night.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Like that?
Then why do you want to go?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
And you expect me to believe that?
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Giron...!
Goodbye.
What is it, madame?
Two lumps, madame?
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Right!
Ever had a romance with a crook?
But you're the more intelligent one.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Holy shit.
Don't you mean work me?
There's a satellite call for you.
What could possible be funny?
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
How you two doin'?
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Yes, exactly!
If only it were that simple.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
And...?
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
What is it? A sapphire?
You're trembling.
I'm so cold.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
Just tell us what you can --
I can explain--
Good afternoon--
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Where'd you get it?
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
You've got lipstick all over you.
I could stand some more--
Where have you been hiding?
Good-by!
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Thanks.
What are you thinking?
What, again?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
I could see you were pining away--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Not a chance.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
My change.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Why?
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
How?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Hello, Denby!
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
I didn't--
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Like it?
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
Do what--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Yes.
Meaning what?
Is that one of the Who's Who?
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Can you read 'em Jack?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
He's all right.
You leave the kid alone.
--you'd go with him!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
There you are, sir.
Sure, Sis.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Beauty, ain't he?
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
What's wrong, Doc?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Very cosmopolitan.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
But Doc-
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
What?
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I didn't mean it that way.
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Oh, all right.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
How you doin', boy?
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
But -
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
I see.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
- Four wheel drive?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Boyfriend?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Not a lot of difference.
If not?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
I don't know. He's not in the database -
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I'm worn out.
Just stay in bed and rest.
What, are you having another party?
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
What's the problem here?
How is everybody?
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
Did you have your child at home?
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
What are you doing?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
That's why.  Sid.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
But why would Andy want me?
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Did I get my package in the mail?
MOM!!  MOM!!
Oh, no!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Will you quit moving around?!
Laser-envy.
You murdering dog!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
It's Sid!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
He's a pyjama case, really.
I like plaits.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
I'm Melanie.
You're well built; how old are you?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
I can't find Manolo.
Helena --
I was just waiting for the right time.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Live with your parents?
I get A's.  All A's.
You do?  What else you do?
What are you doing?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
They're going to walk right past me.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
Where?
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
What do you look for?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
What do you mean?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Where are you going, Diane?
Ssshh!
Sorry.
What?
Come on.
Jesus.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Happy birthday.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Now?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
But try too hard --
Another dab?
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
You Only Live Twice?
OK, so who was it, then?
Roald Dahl.
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Why?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Are you serious?
No, I don't think so.
Sounds great, Swanney.
This had better be good.
Such as?
Six weeks!
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Then I shall make use of this starship.
My pain?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Can we have it quiet?
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
Where did you get this power?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Yes, Captain.
But he does seem familiar?
To land any closer would risk detection.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
Spock... don't.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
What have I done?
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Each man's pain is unique.
My dinner.
Want one?
Your old files -- ?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Did he say why?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Flynn!
Beautiful!
Hello, Alan.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
For sure...
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
The Pentagon?
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
That was uncalled-for.
Yes?
Well, isn't it -- ?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Wrote the...?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Flynn... you can't... I
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
I'm shocked.
Can you cover me for an hour?
That's not true, honey--
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Okay, Dad.
How was school today?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
You're kidding.
Yes.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Harry!  Where are you!
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
Station wagon?
Son of a bitch!
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
He's got it.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Yes.
Oral hygiene?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
That's fabulous Harry.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
Not because you were attracted to him?
Do you still love your husband?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Yes.
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
What?
Who's your little friend?
Like one?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
That was you?!
And you chased one?
Find out who this Renquist it.
Hello, Alabama.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Want some Goobers?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
Where are you from.
Burt Reynolds.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
What are your turn-ons?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
What's that?
Who?
That dazzling imagination.
You have a pimp?
A real live pimp?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
I don't believe so.
I do.
Is this a joke?
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Can you live with it?
Live with what?
Who the fuck are you?
What?
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case of what?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
What are we gonna see?
Want an animal cracker?
What?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
No. No you're not.
I can see what you mean.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Wanna count your money?
I really don't know.
What do you want from me?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I've seen him.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Come again?
He knows.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
What was I sayin'?
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
How do you know? You been there?
We want you to tell us about last night.
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
You smell so good.
See -- you can drive after all!
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
I thought I was in...prison again.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
One way.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
I want my car.
Let me have a Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Wrong number.
I don't know your real name.
You sure you can manage?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Like they're made of polyester.
I have ideas.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
I can't.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
What about us?
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
He was going to--
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John!
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
What brings you to Sierra?
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second--
Hey!
Talk?  About what?
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
Is the job done?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
All I have in the world.
Yeah, well, me too.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
It's the truth, Jake.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
What are you babbling about?
Got any requests?
Oz.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
Soda.  You got any soda?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Hell no!
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Who the hell is this!?
Yeah...
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Next time you'll do just fine.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Jesus.
Wasn't nothing.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Still playing?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You could leave him.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
In <u>cash</u>?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
But I thought --
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
And I love you too.
<u>Jake</u>...
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
One way.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
Morning Grace.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
No baby, you got it wrong.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
Oh.
What about Jeb?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
I remember you.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I'm not sure.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
It's for last week's game.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
That's not what I witnessed David.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I'm going to work out.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How many did you put on that time?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
She back in Kansas?
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
What's all that wood?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
And?
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
N-no, sir?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
What business?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Sally?
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
You ain't like that no more.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Yeah.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Tom?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
Yeah?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
Who ?
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Goddamnit.
Come home, Dean.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
You watch your mouth.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
What did you say?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Someplace else, then.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
What call?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
Edie.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
What does it mean?
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...We did everything we could...
Yes!
Objection!
What book is that?
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
It's a crime.
No.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
... that's all right.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
'Code Blue'...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I read the hospital report on your client.
Her doctors killed her.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
... that's perfectly all right.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
Then why don't you testify?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Thank you for seeing me.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Pardon?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Do you want me to go...?
Not if you don't grow up...
It's over!
Joe...  Joe...
Thank you.
I have to talk to you.
...he's a good man...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
I can't talk now.
That's right.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What are you doing in New York...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's locked.
What?
Mrs...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Yes.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Just let me talk to you.
You won't have to.
I want to know who you are.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Why?!
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
You want me to dress like her?
Yes.
Mmmm.
That's what I had in mind.
No, Ernie's is fine.
Where are you going?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
But why? Why here?
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Yes!
Why?
When?
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I... didn't know where you lived.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Good-bye.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
I don't like them.
No!... No!
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Yes... you run this hotel.
How long has she had the room?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
How do you know? Personal experience?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
That's following a train of thought.
Three whole weeks.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Step number two.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Out. I've got things to do.
Did you need it?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
She died.
She'll be out in a moment.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Well...
Can we have it by tonight?
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Multiple reasons.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Stop it!
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
I am not flexible on this.
Adam! Calm down.
Don't snap at them!
Where's the candy?
Real times.
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
If anything ever happens to me...
I want you to hear me out.
What.
So. When is the wedding.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Your investment ideas never work out.
We need padded chairs.
Shut up Boyd.
Easy Boyd.
I said, what have we done?
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
My what?
Not true.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
Photographer?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Who else?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
We've got problems here.
I need your help.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well you should.
What's the word on the chairs?
I won't even discuss it.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
So what do we do?
I don't hear it.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
What is it?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I have no idea.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Greenpeace?
I guess.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
"You Send Me."
Good times.
How did you know about that?
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
You must listen to me before you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
But what can I say to her, sir?
So, Ramona!
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
And this chest?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
How much do you want for him?
Don't say that.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Yes!
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
I had so many things to think about!
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
I've seen worse.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Only because I got pulled out early.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
I'm still making adjustments...
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
I don't need a baby—sitter.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Give me your wrist.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Sid?
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
There you go —— best seat in the house.
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
Who we got here...?
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story? 
What crisis?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.

We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
What are we going to do?
Oh, God...
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Quite touching.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
Where is he?
Heavy weather East of here.
What's on your mind?
Ask it.
...Yes.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?

They got him standing by.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Big mistake.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.

I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?

No.  You're right.

It concerns his future!

Hey the door was open.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.

They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
Hi sport.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Know the name?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
How much?
Why do you need to wreck this company?
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Upper West Side.
What if I have a previous engagement?
Break it.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
How you doing Buddy?
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
I can't...and I won't.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Did you?
Your husband?
Fireball?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
She said, "You know."  That I know.
Do you?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Toward the end.  You remember?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
No.  No, I don't.
Mrs. Frank?
What's your name?
They're calling me in to work.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Mef?  What's Mef?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
But Claire--
I don't know.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
I think three...
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
It's okay if you're not.
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Did you...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
But what if something happens?
I know.
Oh.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
Well, that's nice.
I'm so sorry.
It's a flare.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Oh.
Are you lonely?
What?
Keep your voice down.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
But I don't remember.
Not personally.
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's too rough.
"You know..."
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
That's not what I'm sayi--
I never asked you to quit!
Do you know it?
What's that for?
I have seen him again.  Last night.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
She didn't feel them
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Lie...?
Go away!  I don't want you here.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
My jury's still out on that,
The one time I want it to work...
What else did you see- Michael...?
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Rowan...?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
You sure...?
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Mm-hmmm...
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
You alright...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
Which do you think is her best shot...
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I lost the touch
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I don't know...
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
At home alone - where were you?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Dr STECKLER?
Yes...?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
That's crazy talk.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Check this out.  Hurry!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
You got everything you ever wanted.
These are real, live women?
We reinvented ourselves.
Yeah?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Watch your tone, mister.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Can you believe that was me?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Your article sucked.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Wow...you clean up nice.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Yellow pages?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
You promise you'll finish school?
I never figured you for a pimp.
I'm warning you.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I told you you could do it.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You saw the news today?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Eliminate the competition.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
We all have...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
What about witnesses?
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
You didn't cuff her?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Is there some reason why you're here?
He... Sam Lombardo?
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Don't forget the car wash.
Kelly...
Why can't you come...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
But check this...
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
There's nothing for them to get.
Where is she?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Yeah, right.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
How...
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Aha!
Starting with a screw?
Limestone quarry?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
No record of him.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Oh, thank you.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He calls it the Tarantula.
Anyone?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You tell me.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
That would be... the Mexican War?
Easy now.
Who was this partner of his?
Now it's a bomb.
They're coming.
Hey...!
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Say what?
Sorsha.
Smells like a battle.
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Fresh goat's milk.
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
I don't know, Willow.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She's hungry.
Queen Cherlindrea?
I'm getting her out of there!
This is not going well.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
I thought I was the English.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Are you really ever coming back?
Yeah.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Who else knows?
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
You have no right to keep us here.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why?
Who are they?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I know.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Where's my baggy pants?
I got there late, John.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
I hear you.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Everything okay?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
Who was that man?
You might have killed him!
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Uhh -- yeah --
If any!
Our echo.
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Toto, too.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oil can what?
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Dorothy next!
Up!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
It's a whatzis.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Mr. Gale!
You mean she bit you?
...junk!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Let's.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
...to Dorothy!
No, you don't.
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
He survived?
The inside man?
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
What is it?
What the hell are you doing here?
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
A rope!
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
What?!
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
No idea who's behind this?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
What -- am I --
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
What is it?  How does it work?
And what if you¹re wrong?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Laurie --
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
What?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I think he's going to the john.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
No comment.
I don't know their real names.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Who are you?
We hung out last night, remember?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
What was that for?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
What...?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Why you dogging me up?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
What's this?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
We all do.
What's wrong with him?
Are you all right?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
What are you going to do?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
What?
Hello...?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Will you miss me?
Oh, nice.
Whatever makes you happy.
You're incorrigible!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
What a strange fellow.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
You mean... the laboratory??
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
Break that old man's violin.
I didn't do that.
Nineteen, sir.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
I beg your pardon?
Wockers with the knockers???
What?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
But you did -- I just heard it.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Yes.
Yes, Master!
Where is he?
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Extremely well.
Ooh!
Oh, doctor!
Are you serious??
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I see what you mean.
What?
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
How do you know they're done?
Yes.
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Which one?
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
